The streetlight bobs... and then begins to sway.\n\n    We slowly begin to rise up on the streetlight to reveal... a\n\n    small bird has landed on it. We continue to rise to reveal,\n\n    behind the bird...\n\n\n\n    Wind blows through the   gargantuan evergreens that seem to\n\n    engulf the narrow main   street of a small town in upstate New\n\n    York. Shop windows and   cars on either side covered in dust,\n\n    the place seems frozen   in time. There is no movement.\n\n\n\n    In the very middle of the road one can see... sand. A bizarre\n\n    incongruity, a long pathway about a shovels width runs the\n\n    full length of the street with offshoots into open doorways\n\n    of some of the shops.\n\n\n\n    We hold for a long moment:\n\n\n\n\n\n2   INT.

She reaches out her hand.\n\n\n\n    WE GO CLOSE ON HER HAND as it reaches toward a shelf... of\n\n    orange prescription drug bottles. Her hand suddenly begins to\n\n    shift certain bottles ever so slightly... AT A BIZARRELY SLOW\n\n    PACE... she does not make a sound. As she does this, we get\n\n    our first glimpse... of names. Names of drugs. Names... of\n\n    people.\n\n\n\n    HER HAND finally arrives at the very back of the shelf as she\n\n    gently twists a bottle that reads... AMOXICILLIN.\n\n\n\n    ON THE MOTHER... as she inhales slowly? And then, as if\n\n    doing surgery, she slowly closes her hand around the bottle\n\n    and GENTLY begins to move it through the shelf toward her.\n\n    Her hand, once again moves incredibly slowly, her now wider\n\n    closed hand shifts even more bottles as it passes. JUST as\n\n    she gets to the end of the shelf a bottle shifts... with a\n\n    RATTLE of pills. This is the first, deliberate sound we've\n\n    heard. The mother...

The little brother. This is MARCUS\n\n     ABBOTT, now 10. Moving ever so slightly, MARCUS is obviously\n\n     pretending to drive... though his impassive face betrays the\n\n     idea that he is having any fun. MARCUS seems to have aged\n\n     much more than the mere 2 years.

REGAN's eyes begin to rise... higher... and\n\nhigher above EVELYN.\n\n\n\nWE CUT TO EVELYN TO SEE...\n\n\n\nA LARGE SHADOW RISES UP BEHIND HER!!!!\n\n\n\nEVELYN seeing REGAN's eyes rise... just knows.\n\n\n\nIn one swift motion EVELYN suddenly springs up... and aims\n\nthe shotgun directly at the CREATURE.\n\n\n\nWE CUT WIDE to see... and hear, the room... is totally still.\n\n\n\nFor the rest of this scene...Like the greatest of westerns,\n\nwe are in the most epic... of standoffs. Time... stands\n\nstill. Air... doesn't move. Tension... is dripping from the\n\nwalls.\n\n\n\nON REGAN... holding her breath... just stares\n\n\n\nON MARCUS... frozen behind the water tank... just stares.\n\n\n\nON EVELYN... arm outstretched, with weapon ready... just\n\nstares.\n\n\n\nON THE CREATURE... SLOWLY OPENING ITS PLATES!!!!\n\n\n\nAs the monitors once again... go fuzzy.... Each of the humans\n\ncan only watch as these small plates open with the suction of\n\nanatomical goo...\n\n\n\nThey can only watch as the plates crackle ever so slightly...\n\nas they turn... and search...\n\n\n\n...for the sound that will end it all.\n\n\n\nCLOSE on sweat dripping down from MARCUS's forehead. TRACKING\n\nDOWN MARCUS' face, we see the inevitable path his sweat will\n\ntake until we leave his face and arrive on... The baby.\n\n\n\nCLOSE ON EVELYN's arm... as it begins to quiver...\n\n                                                           77.\n\n\n\n\n\nCLOSE ON EVELYN'S eyes as her brain makes the realization...\n\nshe can't hold this gun much longer...\n\n\n\nCLOSE ON THE CREATURE... as it opens more...",

ANYTHING!\n\n\n\nREGAN's POV as her eyes search the room... search the wall...\n\nsearch the boards. Finally her eyes land on one specific\n\nthing on her father's board... She sees the phrase...\n\n\n\n`WEAPON??'.\n\nSuddenly...\n\n\n\nREGAN... reaches up to touch her mother's arm.\n\n\n\nEVELYN looks down at REGAN...\n\n\n\nREGAN gently shakes her head then gently touches EVELYN's\n\narm... and slowly lowers the gun.\n\n\n\nEVELYN looks down at her daughter... her eyes begin to well\n\nup... this is it...

There in the palm of REGAN's hand... are\n\nhearing aids.\n\n\n\nREGAN slowly turns to her father's work bench to see the pile\n\nof hearing aids her father... made... sitting just in front\n\nof the microphone of the HAM RADIO.\n\n\n\nREGAN looks back up to the board at the phrase...\n\n\"WEAPON??\".\n\n\n\nREGAN looks to the creature still searching the room for\n\nsound.\n\n\n\nREGAN raises her hand to her ear...
