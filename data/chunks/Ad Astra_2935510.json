And it’s not just\nmachines; a select few highly-\ntrained folks from the Army Corps\nof Engineers will have to check\nevery inch of the carbon fiber for\nflaws. It has proven one of the\nmost demanding jobs on Earth, but\nthese men and women are up to the\ntask. Engineer Major Roy McBride\nof Las Cruces, New Mexico, says\nhe’s not afraid of the challenge:\n\nIMAGE OF FOUR YOUNG MEN and TWO YOUNG WOMEN, seated on a\nSOFA, in a nondescript office environment with an Army Corps\nof Engineers logo/graphic on a screen behind them.\n\nOne of them is ROY MCBRIDE.\n\nRoy McBride: forties, handsome. His eyes are light blue,\nseemingly friendly, but reveal little about the man himself.\nHe is even-tempered, but one would not call him kind; there\nis an icy quality to him. Still, he is not overtly cruel or\npetty, and to talk to him, one could never question his\nintentions or his integrity.\n\nRoy speaks slowly, formally, deliberately, as though he does\nnot want ever to repeat himself. He seems guarded, sincere,\nprecise, competent. His face is blank but prone to the\noccasional awkward joke, and those jokes are made almost for\nself-amusement. He does not seem morose.\n\fIn fact, he smiles all the time, and his face often lights up\nwith little motivation. He speaks with a very slight\nMidwestern/Western accent. Think Neil Armstrong.\n\nAs he speaks, on the screen appears the title “Maj. Roy C.\nMcBride”.\n\nROY MCBRIDE\n\nThe Army Corps of Engineers trains\nus to deal with our fears.

ADULTS speak to each other,\nstanding behind the children, watching them play, making\nsmall talk. The scene has a strange, dare we say, unearthly\nquality to it. There is a distance to it; not an emotional\ndistance, but a visual distance. A haze, almost. A\ndreamlike quality.\n\nA SMALLER GROUP of adults, and two children, are here, too.\nThey are nearby and yet somehow apart.\n\nWe SEE: ROY’S MOTHER, LEANNE. Much YOUNGER. She seems\nPREOCCUPIED, though she smiles a lot as she attends to the\nchildren. Also here is some other woman we don’t know, about\nLeanne's age. She is completely quiet, almost nervous, as\nshe watches the children play.\n\nThen there is H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE, who is involved with the\nchildren, making hats for them, drawing for them, joking with\nthem.\n\nAMONG THE CHILDREN: the young ROY. And the young FRANCESCA\n(though she is older than Roy--she seems around 16 or 17, he\naround 8).
