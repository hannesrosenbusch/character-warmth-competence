But I don't want it to become the\n\n          summation of her life. Because it's not.\n\n          When her Lisa died I said to her, \"How can\n\n          you stand it?\" And she said. \"First of all\n\n          I can't.

And I know a lot\n\n          of people feel that teenagers are really\n\n          naive, which they are, many of them. But\n\n          they still haven't had a chance to get\n\n          burned out by the disappointments and the\n\n          harsh realities of learning how to play the\n\n          game.

NIGHT. 173\n\n\n\n           Lisa hurries down the long aisle. The LIGHTS DIM. The \n\n           audience applauds the entering conductor. She picks her way \n\n           past the other patrons in the row, whispering \"Excuse me\" and\n\n           takes her seat just as the MUSIC STARTS. Joan looks at her. \n\n           Lisa stares straight ahead. \n\n\n\n           The curtain rises. On stage, the two women start singing the \n\n          barcarole \"Belle Nuit.\" It's very beautiful.\n\n          Joan looks next to her at Lisa. Lisa is trying not to cry,\n\n          but tears are dripping slowly down her face. She sniffs and\n\n          wipes them away, but they keep coming.\n\n          Joan looks at her again, but Lisa still won't look at her.\n\n          Joan takes Lisa's hand and Lisa breaks down completely,\n\n          clutching Joan's hand back, squeezing it hard. Joan starts\n\n          crying too out of sympathy.\n\n\n\n          As the duet goes on they sit side by side holding hands, Lisa\n\n          crying and holding on and wiping her eyes with her free hand\n\n          and Joan crying too, but not as hard, grateful finally that\n\n          the spell has been broken.\n\n\n\n          The duet ends and we CUT TO BLACK.\n\n\n\n                         THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n"
