They race for the ladder.\n\f109.\n\nKang LUNGES -- and Banning grabs his knife hand. They SMASH\ninto the wall -- furiously grappling. Kang DRIVES a fist\ninto Banning’s kidney. Banning grunts, nearly fainting.\nKang leaps back. Connects with a SPIN KICK to Banning’s\nhead. Banning FALLS. Kang LEAPS onto Banning, straddling\nhim. Banning BLOCKS Kang’s fatal knife thrust -- but the\nblade bears down -- directly over Banning’s heart --\n\nThe two lock in a DEATH EMBRACE, but Kang has the advantage.\nHe BEARS DOWN harder. Banning struggles beneath him.\n\nSlowly -- inexorably -- the blade ARCS DOWN. The tip PIERCES\nBanning’s skin, drawing blood...\n\nWhen from the wall above, a telltale HISS.\n\nWith the last of his strength, Banning pushes Kang’s face up.\nDirectly in line with the recessed venting pipe --\n\nA SCALDING JET OF STEAM\n\nEXPLODES from the wall.\n\nThe force of the BLAST blows Kang off Banning. The tanto\ngoes spinning into the water. Kang staggers back, grimacing\nwith rage and pain. He scrambles for his pistol across the\nplatform.\n\nBanning LEAPS up, races for the substation ladder.\n\nKang GRABS the pistol, whirls.

Checks his wound.\n\nASHER\nYou okay?\n\nBanning nods, wincing.\n\nThe two share a long look. A whirlwind of emotions pass\nbetween them.\n\nASHER (cont’d)\nThank you --\n\nAsher pulls his son close, grateful.\nBanning’s eyes fill with sweet redemption.\n\nVOICES (O.S.)\nOver here!\n\nArmy Rangers converge on Banning and the President from\nacross the Mall.\n\f112.\n\nINT.
