Through the\nwindows, we see the wind blowing olive trees in a courtyard.\nMiles continues to compose as we SEE his PRETTY GIRLFRIEND in\nthe b.g., talking on her cell as she gets dressed. An actress\nno doubt.\n\nOver, we HEAR the VOICE OF A YOUNG ENGLISH WOMAN, IRIS.\nIris' Voice is knowing and warm.\n\nIRIS (V.0.)\nI have found almost everything ever\nwritten about love to be true.\nShakespeare said, \"Journeys end\nwhen lovers meet.\" What an\nextraordinary thought. Personally I\nhave not experienced anything\nremotely close to that but I’m more\nthan willing to believe Shakespeare\nhad. I suppose I think about love\nmore than anyone really should. I\nam constantly amazed by it's sheer\npower and by all its subtleties and\ncomplexities.\n\nMiles' Girlfriend passes behind the computer screen and\nMiles, taken with her, seems to now compose to her beauty.\nShe, however, is in a rush and doesn’t seem to notice. Miles\nreaches for her with one arm, kisses her hand, still playing\nthe keyboard with the other. She looks at him impatiently.\nOblivious to this, Miles watches her exit as he continues to\nplay.\n\nIRIS (V.0.) (CONT'D)\nIt was Shakespeare who also said,\n\"Love is blind\".

GRAHAM'S LIVING ROOM - MUSIC OVER\n\nOlivia, in a party dress and carrying a noise maker, runs\nthrough the room. She is followed by her Aunt Iris, also in\na party dress. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n Iris dances a bit as she carries two glasses\nof champagne. She delivers one glass to Miles who is\nsitting on the sofa, deep in conversation with Sophie. He\nsmiles when he sees Iris.\n\nAmanda dances in with a tray of hors d'oeuvres. She stops in\nfront of Graham who twirls her. Amanda then dances over to\nIris who takes an hors d'oeuvre and the two women connect.\nAmanda whispers something to Iris and Iris laughs. Graham\njoins them and puts his arm around his sister. Iris rests\nher head on his shoulder. Feels like the makings of a great\nparty. Camera pulls back and away, out the window and\neventually we Fade to Black.\n\f"
