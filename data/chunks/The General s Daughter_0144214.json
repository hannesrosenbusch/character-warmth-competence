BRENNER\nGive it up, Colonel. Fowler, face stone, eyes black, stares at him, past reason or\nredemption. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\n Several soldiers make a move toward him, he cuts\nthe air with his steel, growling, they leap back as the crowd\nshouts out.\n\f119\n\nHe glares savagely at Brenner, swinging his blade in a circle,\nthe sun gleaming off the razor-honed edge of it. He advances.\nBrenner and Sunhill drop down defensively, level their weapons\nas the ring of onlookers fall back.\n\nBRENNER\nHalt!\n\nFowler raises the blade over his head. The blast of a gunshot\nsplits the air, a row of medals exploding off his chest. The\nColonel lurches, topples face forward, dead as he hits ground.\n\nThe agents, frozen in a crouch, stare in astonishment, weapons\nunfired. The crowd stunned, silent, parting across the circle\nof the clearing, leaving one man standing alone.\n\nGeneral Campbell. His officer’s Beretta in his hand, features\nterrible, eyes hollow.\n\nHe lowers his gun. It slips from his fingers. Pandemonium.\n\nEXT. MAIN BOULEVARD - FORT HADLEY - DAY\nHot Georgia sky. Shadeless lawn. Chanting. A file of young,\n\nhead-shaven recruits moving in step-time along the road, their\ndrill sergeant dogging them.\n\nSunhill's Mustang, one flank scraped and battered, drives past\nthem, moving toward the main gate.\nEXT. MAIN GATE - FORT HADLEY - DAY\nShe stands outside her car, shading her eyes. Brenner’s pick-\nup approaches. The truck stops, he gets out, crosses the road\n\nto her.\n\nThey stand facing each other, glad to see each other, sorry it\nmay be the last time.\n\nBRENNER\nSo you're really out.\n\nSUNHILL\nIt had to be that way.\n\nBrenner nods, understanding. She gazes at him, regretfully.\n\nSUNHILL\nWhat happens to you?\n\f120\n\nBRENNER\nI’m not sure... They can't decide\nwhether to give me a medal or hang\nme. Maybe I‘1ll just cash out.\n\nSUNHILL\nYou're a lifer, Brenner.\n\nBRENNER\nYeah. I guess I am.\n\nThey smile, their attraction to each other seen in their eyes.",

They stand close to each other, wanting to\nembrace. Instead, he extends his hand, in respect. Her eyes\nhold her own regard, sincerity.\n\nSUNHILL\nThank you. For everything.\n\nTheir handshake lingers. Sunhill turns, her eyes damp, enters\nher car. He leans over her window. She looks up at him.\n\nSUNHILL\nI turned a corner in my life... My\nfather. The General. Fowler. The\nArmy, what it stands for... they all\ngot it wrong.\n\nBrenner stares at her, somber.\n\nSUNHILL\nWho really killed her, Brenner?\n\nBRENNER\nEverybody.\n\nTheir gaze lasts a moment more. She smiles a plaintive smile,\na look of goodbye. Then she starts the car, turning her eyes\nto the future.\n\nBrenner remains there, watching her pull out, her car drawing\naway on the road, receding.\n\nFADE OUT\n\f"
