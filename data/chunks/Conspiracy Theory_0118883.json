MANHATTAN STREETS - CAB - DAY\n\n        Behind the wheel:  JERRY FLETCHER.  Flat-out handsome if\n        not for his eyes.  Someone rash, someone making an\n        uninformed decision might call them crazy eyes.  He stops\n        across from an apartment building, TOOTS his HORN.\n\n\n        IN DOORWAY\n\n        A woman and a man, a CYNIC, appear.  Jerry smiles as they\n        kiss goodnight.  A bit of desperate passion.  She watches\n        after him as he gets in the cab.\n\n                                CYNIC\n                  Luxembourg Towers on 7th.\n\n\n        INT. CAB\n\n        Jerry nods, rolls out.  The Cynic watches the door to\n        1257 close, then sighs.  Jerry looks at him in the\n        rearview.\n\n                                JERRY\n                  The sound of love.\n\n                                CYNIC\n                  Excuse me?\n\n        Jerry exhales an exaggerated sigh.\n\n                                JERRY\n                  That's love.\n\n                                CYNIC\n                  Love?  Love's just a pretty way of\n                  saying, 'I want to sleep with\n                  you'.  Love is bullshit.\n\n                                JERRY\n                  I live on tips, so don't be\n                  offended, but you're a liar.  I\n                  saw you kiss.  Admit it, this is\n                  the street where love lives.\n\n        The Cynic looks back over his shoulder.  Down love\n        street.  As Jerry hangs a right, the Cynic faces forward.\n\n                                JERRY\n                  Love gives you wings.  It makes\n                  you fly.  I don't even call it\n                  love.  I call it Geronimo.\n\n                                CYNIC\n                  Geronimo?\n\n                                JERRY\n                  Geronimo.  When you're really in\n                  love, you'll jump.  Off the top of\n                  the Empire State.

As the well-dressed man starts over,\n        Jerry sizes him up.  The man seems suddenly sinister.\n\n        As he reaches for the door, LOCKS CLICK DOWN.  Jerry GUNS\n        the CAB away.  The confused man stumbles back, shouts,\n        apparently not a threat at all.\n\n\n        EXT.

CAB - NIGHT\n\n        Jerry glances at a lit 2nd floor apartment window, then\n        settles in with a bologna sandwich.  About to take a\n        bite, he pauses, removes a slice of bologna.  He regards\n        it a beat, then carefully peels off the edge.  Jerry\n        holds the narrow casing up against the glow of a\n        streetlight, like it was encoded.

Walking a few\n        moments before she's jogging, before she's running.  No\n        easy pace here.  Liza gets grim, cranks up the speed and\n        goes hard.  She's punishing herself.\n\n\n        JERRY\n\n        His voice trails off as he watches.  Sad, he lowers the\n        binoculars, doesn't want to watch her do this.
