BURGUNDIAN COUNTRYSIDE - SUNRISE - 1892 1\n\nThe first light is breaking over the fields and hedges of\nthis timeless rural landscape. With the clanking of bells,\na herd of cows makes its way to the first milking.\n\nINT. COLETTE FAMILY HOME - BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING 2\n\nThe room is simple with a few sticks of worn wooden\nfurniture. A young woman is asleep under the covers, with a\ncat curled up on the bottom of the bed. This is GABRIELLE-\nSIDONIE COLETTE, or as she will later be known, simply\nCOLETTE.\n\nA voice calls from down the corridor - her mother SIDO.\n\nSIDO (0.S.)\nGabrielle!\n\nThe girl stirs but her eyes remain stubbornly closed.\n\nSIDO (0.S.) (CONT'D)\nGabrielle!! Wake up.\n\nCOLETTE\n(murmuring)\nLet me sleep!\n\nSIDO\nCome on, Gabrielle!!\n\nSido is now at the door frame. A handsome country woman,\nforthright and practical - nobody’s fool.\n\nCOLETTE\nWhat time is it?\n\nSIDO\nIt’s 8 o’clock. Willy is coming today.\n\nColette just murmurs.\nSIDO (cont’d) (CONT'D)\n\nGood. Then you won’t want your\n\nhair doing.\nShe disappears. After a moment, a head emerges from under\nthe pillow and looks to the empty doorway. We get our first\nlook at the milky skinned, precocious, whip-smart, Colette.\nEXT.

Willy is seated, in\n\nconversation with Sido and JULES, the patriarch, an affable\nold soldier, with one leg, who is smoking a pipe.\n\nJULES\nAnd how is Paris these days,\nWilly?\n\nWILLY\n\nIt’s a hot bed! It’s “Electric!”\nHeaving with artists, writers,\npoets, all seeking to say\n\nsomething profound... most of them\nare too young or crazed but still,\nthey do generate a certain... life\nforce!\n\nColette, her hair neatly plaited, puts the cups out for\neveryone then takes over the teapot and pours.\n\nJULES\nWe were going to see a play in\nParis - weren’t we?\n\nSIDO\nLa Tosca.\n\nWILLY\nI was at the opening. I wouldn’t\nbother, quite frankly. Sarah Bernhardt\ndid her best, she always does, but the\npiece is too overwrought in a\nparticularly feminine way...\nmelodramatic in extremis! Tears on the\nstage but all dry eyes in the house.\n\nSIDO\n\nMaybe I'11 go and make up my own mind.\nWILLY\n\nWell, just remember... if a book bores\n\nyou, you can throw it away. If a\npainting is garish, you close your\neyes.\n\n(MORE )\n\fCOLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 3.\n\nWILLY (CONT'D)\nWhereas bad theatre is like dentistry;\nyou are compelled to stay in the chair,\nhaving your skull drilled, until the\nentire grizzly procedure is over.\n\nJULES\nGood point, Willy. Painful business!\n\nCOLETTE\nThough I imagine it must hold a secret\nsource of enjoyment - for the dentist.\nWilly raises an appreciative eyebrow and chuckles.\nWILLY\nIndeed... Oh - I almost forgot. A\nsmall gift.\n\nHe reaches in his pocket and pulls out a small package. She\nunwraps it to find a SNOW GLOBE OF PARIS.\n\nCOLETTE\nThank you.

Colette is holding her comfortable\n\nold cat which she hands off to her mother.\n\nCOLETTE\nSido, I’m going for a walk.\n\nSIDO\nChange your dress first.\n\nCOLETTE\nI’1l stay on the path.\n\nSIDO\nChange it!\n\fCOLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 4.\n\nINT. COLETTE FAMILY HOUSE - STAIRS - MINUTES LATER 8\n\nNow in a different dress, Colette starts to come down stairs.\nHearing her parents talking in the kitchen, she slows up,\nlistening carefully.\n\nSIDO (0.S.)\nThere’s something about him I find\nsuspect... something disingenuous.\n\nJULES (0.S.)\n\nOh, not in my reckoning... He’s a\ngood man. He has a reputation,\nyes, but there comes a time ina\nman’s life to settle down...and\nshe’s the right age for it. She’ll\nbe twenty next time around.\n\nSIDO (0.S.)\n\nI just worry that he won’t\nunderstand her. That girl said her\nfirst word at nine months. She was\nalways reading, way ahead of her\nclass, she was the lead in the\nschool play - every year.\n\nJULES (0.S.)\nMy dear, would anyone be good\nenough for you?\n\nSIDO\nHmmph.\n\nNow on the ground floor Colette waits outside the door as\nher parents talk. Sido moves into view by the kitchen sink.\n\nSIDO (CONT'D)\nHave you finished the letter to\nhis father?\n\nJULES\nI keep starting but I can’t seem\nto finish it. A girl without a\ndowry, -that just doesn’t happen\nin their circles. They may cut him\noff if he marries her.\n\nSIDO\nSo they call it off.

Take this - for blackberries.\n(hands her a pot)\nI’m making a tart tomorrow. And\ndon’t be late back.\n\nCOLETTE\n(eye roll)\nI won't...\n\nSido watches her daughter, not without suspicion, as she\ntakes off across the garden.\n\nEXT. SAINT-SAUVEUR — COUNTRYSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON 9\n\nColette runs down a path, then backs up, picks a few prime\nblackberries, and continues on.\n\nShe moves through the woods, with the stealth of an animal\nthen breaks out across a broad green meadow towards a barn.\n\nEXT. OLD BARN — LATE AFTERNOON 10\n\nShe approaches the gaping black door of a dilapidated barn.\n\nINT. OLD BARN 11\n\nEntering the darkness, Colette blinks to re-adjust her\neyes. A flutter of wings attracts her attention. She turns\nto see an ascending pigeon. Then, below, a tired old horse.\n\nCOLETTE\nWhere are you?\n\nWILLY\nOver here. Enjoying the simple\npleasures of country life!\n\nBehind a partition, she sees Willy, reclining on a pile of\n\nstraw.\n\fCOLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 6.\n\nCOLETTE\nYou look at home in the hay.\n\nWILLY\nI think I might be!

So if my\ncalculations are correct...\n\nCOLETTE\nWe have time - if we’re quick.\n\nWILLY\nYes, we do.\n\nHe smiles, moved by her beauty, kisses her, then breaks\noff.\n\nCOLETTE\nWhat?\n\nWILLY\nI just can’t say how unimaginably\nhappy I am, Gabrielle.\n\nCOLETTE\nSo am I.\n\nHe holds her by her shoulders firmly.\n\nWILLY\nI adore you.\n\nHe kisses her shoulder. Feeling his beard brush against her\nskin, Colette smiles as they move into a passionate embrace. A\nnearby horse chews hay as they proceed to take their clothes\noff.\n\n11A INT. COLETTE’S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 11A\n\nColette sprawls out on the bed, her hair in plaits. She is\nwriting a letter in a school exercise book in pencil, resting\non an encyclopaedia.\n\nCOLETTE\nDear Willy, As I walked home by the\nriver, the light shining through\nthe trees, my heart filled with a\nkind of delicious pride.

Almost as much as\nyour mother will...\n\nA murmur of acknowledgement from the assembled. Colette\nsmiles at her father, and catches her mother’s eye, holding\nback emotion.\n\nJULES (CONT'D)\nBut it is no small compensation that I\ngive her to a man of such inestimable\nstanding. There are many celebrities\nin Paris but few are famous enough to\nbe known by -- by a single name.\n\nWILLY - Welcome to the Colette family.\n\nEveryone cheers. Colette turns to her new husband,\nglowing.\n\nSOME TIME LATER - EVENING\n\nA COUNTRY BAND strikes up. COUPLES polka around the\ngarden.\n\nA COUPLE OF PEASANTS carry trays of drinks from a kitchen\ntent to the GUESTS. Some CHILDREN chase a chicken through the\ndancers.\n\nWILLY (cont'd)\nThis is definitely a country wedding.\n\nCOLETTE\nIt’ll make a good story -- in Paris.\n\nWILLY\nYou'll be the story in Paris,\nGabrielle.

Matilde hovers nervously.\n\nCOLETTE (CONT’D)\nIs the carriage waiting?\n\nWilly looks disappointed but together they proceed through\nSEVERAL ROOMS to the front door. We get a feeling for Willy's\napartment - a warren of dark rooms overcrowded by boxes, papers\nand Wagnerian bric-a-brac.

She is taking tea with her\ncompanion, a pretty young girl named LILY.\n\nLILY\n(whispering)\nColette and Willy are here!\n\nGEORGIE\nSo they are. Don’t stare.\n\nAcross the patio, Colette and Willy are seated by a WAITER.\nGeorgie takes out a small card and scribbles a note.\n\nGEORGIE (CONT'D)\nGo take this to them.\n\nMOMENTS LATER\nPost-exercise the couple are eating cake.\n\nCOLETTE\nMmmm.

CAFE NOIR - EVENING 93\n\nIn the high ceilinged cafe, we follow a WAITER who drops a\nbill off at a table where Georgie and Colette are in fits of\nhysterics - the kind of laughter sustained by the seriously\ndrunk and flirtatious. Willy is providing the after-dinner\nentertainment. Lily sits by them, awed at getting to spend\ntime with such celebrities, autograph book at the ready.\n\nGEORGIE\n(almost crying with\nlaughter)\nThat’s so funny. Did he really say that?\n\nCOLETTE\nOh yes - he would. He is such a\ncolossal snob.\n\nWILLY\nThen Mme de Caillavet happened to\nmention that he was only a baron\nand not a Marquise. “Allow me, he\nsaid “I am also Duke of Anjou,\nBishop of Coutances, Prince of\nJoinville, of Asturias, of Orléans\nand the Dunes. But all that isn't\nof the slightest importance...\n(with perfect timing)\n..-here.”\n\nEveryone howls with laughter. A stray curl of her hair\nfalls down over Georgie’s face.\n\nCOLETTE\nWait a moment.\n\nColette takes the lock and tries to pat it back into place.\nA moment of electricity passes between the two. Willy\nwatches fascinated.\n\nCOLETTE (CONT’D)\nHold still. That’s it.\n\nShe takes her hands away. The disobedient lock immediately\nfalls back down.
