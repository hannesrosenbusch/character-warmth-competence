THE COUNTESS OF TRENTHAM’S HOUSE. DAY. NOVEMBER. 1932.\n\nIt is a grey day. Mary Maceachran, a young Scottish lady's maid,\nwatches a liveried chauffeur trying to start a green 1920s\nDaimler in front of a London house. The chauffeur, Merriman,\nclimbs out with a crank handle which he fits and turns.\n\nMERRIMAN\nJust start, you filthy heap of scrap.\n\nMARY\nShe’ll hear you one of these days.\n\nMERRIMAN\nI don’t care if she does.\n\nMARY\nDon’t you just?\n\nThe motor catches and he stands. While the passenger seats are\nenclosed, the front, driving seat is open to the weather. Mary\nplaces a basket with a thermos glass and a sealed, tin sandwich\ncontainer on the rear seat. As she does so, it begins to rain.\n\nBUTLER (VO)\nMary? Merriman? Are you ready?\n\nWith a final check, she looks up to where a butler in a black\nmorning coat waits.\n\nMARY\nYes, Mr Burkett.\n\nWe can hardly hear his “Everything's ready, milady,” nor can we\nsee the face behind the veil of the figure who hurries down the\nsteps. This is Constance, Countess of Trentham. Muffled in furs\nagainst the cold, she hurries into the waiting vehicle.\n\nThe titles run over the following sequence.\n\nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY.\n\nMerriman drives. Mary sits silently next to him, huddling into\nher coat. Unlike the passenger, the servants, in the roofless\nfront seat, are exposed to the rain.\n\nINT. CONSTANCE’S CAR.

It is bright with shining chrome. It looks like Tomorrow\nnext to the Daimler’s Yesterday. A man in the front passenger\nseat looks out helpfully. He speaks in a Californian accent.\n\nWEISSMAN\nDo you need any help? Are you O.K.?\n\nThe door is open now and, behind the maid, the indistinct\npassenger speaks.\n\nCONSTANCE\nAm I what?\n\nMARY\nWe‘re quite all right. Thank you.\n\nIVOR\nExcuse me but.. is that..

The\nother car drives away.\n\nMARY\nWas that really Ivor Novello?\n\nCONSTANCE\nCould we get on before I freeze to\ndeath?\n\nThe maid shuts the car door, climbs in and the journey\ncontinues. The credits end.\n\nEXT, GOSFORD PARK. DAY.\n\nThe great house stands confidently in its park, proclaiming its\nsocial pre-eminence. As the car continues down the drive, it\ncatches the attention of a beautiful woman who is cantering on\nher horse, Topaz. She wears jodphurs and a loosely tied neck\nscarf over her hacking jacket.
