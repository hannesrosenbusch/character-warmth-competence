She@s sorting through a stack of old record albums, looking\nthrough them as she\n\npiles them in a box. We catch sight of some relics from the disco\nera as well as several\n\nclassic country albums - Donny Osmond and the @Saturday Night\nFever@® soundtrack\n\nmixed in with Patsy Cline and Hank Williams and Elvis. After a\nbrief look, she piles\n\nthem in a box and closes the lid. She looks outside her window\nand sees the sun\n\ncoming up; she@s been up all night.\n\nMiranda goes over to the window and opens it. It@s barely light\nout, but already the\n\nsound of someone@s radio filters in.

They have a boom box, and we\nhear loud street\n\nmusic. Miranda comes out of her building carrying a moving box.\nShe wears Levi@s cut\n\noff mid-thigh, sneakers, and a black leather jacket over a white y-\nshirt. She carries the\n\nbox down the front steps and drops it on a pile on the sidewalk in\nfront of a waiting cab.\n\fThe cab driver just leans against his car, watching her work.\n\nMIRANDA\n\nYou know what would be great?
