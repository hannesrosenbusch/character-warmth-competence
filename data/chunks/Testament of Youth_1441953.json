EXT. HOTEL GARDEN. DAY\n\nA terribly English face, its pale skin flushed in the crisp\nspringtime sun. Short, fair hair. Jacket and tie. A highly\nintelligent face, persuasive too. The face of a fifty-year-\nold man who is sitting, legs crossed, in the pretty garden of\na hotel.\n\nSlightly behind him sit two younger assistants.\n\nAnd behind them, a beautiful swimming pool. Only a few\nbathers, all of them wrapped in identical, soft white robes.\nA lazy, early morning, vacation atmosphere.\n\nJacuzzis dot the flawless lawn around the pool.\n\nIn the background, a magnificent hotel. Welcoming, dignified,\nand luxurious all at once.\n\nAnd framing the hotel, reigning over it, are the mountains.\n\nThe fifty-year-old man takes out a pack of cigarettes and is\nabout to light up when a calm, uncritical voice warns him.\n\nCALM VOICE\nYou can’t smoke here.\n\nFIFTY-YEAR OLD\nNot even outside?\n\nCALM VOICE\nNot even inside.\n\nThe calm voice belongs to the man sitting across from him.\nEnglish, about eighty years old, in a soft beige jacket and\ntrousers, and eyeglasses with imposing black frames, behind\nwhich nest watery, light blue eyes, laden with melancholy and\ncunning. We’re talking about Fred Ballinger.\n\nThere’s a small table between them. An open newspaper in\nfront of Fred. He is calm, placid, serene, but a vague\ndisenchantment hovers in his eyes. In what we realize is a\nhabitual gesture, he unwraps a candy and pops it in his\nmouth. He’s clearly a regular consumer of such candies.\n\nFIFTY-YEAR OLD\nPardon me, Mr. Ballinger, or may I\ncall you Maestro?\n\nFred Ballinger shrugs his shoulders. It really doesn’t matter\nto him.",

We\ncan safely assume that she’s a hooker, but a hooker sui\ngeneris.\n\nFred forgets to look at her, and she pays no attention to\nhim.\n\nAlone, Fred Ballinger makes his way down the hallway, taking\ntiny, slow steps. Next to every door are pairs of hiking\nboots, neatly arranged, which the guests have put out to be\naired.\n\nIn the silence of the night, an old man in an electric\nwheelchair overtakes Fred and vanishes around a corner.\n\nThe sound of a violin comes from one of the rooms, stopping\nFred in his tracks. He turns, searching for the source. It\nstarts up again, from the beginning: only two notes, played\npoorly. Someone’s obviously practicing, one of those really\ntedious exercises.\n\nFred takes a step in the direction of the sound, but it stops\nagain.\n\f11.\n\nHe is about to keep walking when he encounters his reflection\nin a mirror.

In the early\nmorning light, we watch a slow swarm of rich Russians drop\nonto chaise lounges to sunbathe, and a handsome black\nAmerican family, immobile in the pool.\n\nOff to one corner, outdoor massages are available, in the\nshade of a beautiful canopy. Two teenage boys, in the swirl\nof a hormonal tempest, are hanging around there, furtively\neyeing a beautiful woman who is getting an gentle, oriental\nstyle massage.\n\nFew guests, all of them wealthy.\n\nWe can make out a pair of parachutists in the distance, set\nagainst the crisp, imposing mountains.\n\nAn elderly couple has dozed off in their electric\nwheelchairs.\n\nTheir Asian caregivers are as discreet and invisible as mice.\n\nA fifty-year old son does gymnastics with his decrepit\nfather.\n\f21.\n\nAt the far end of the garden, near the hedges that act as a\nfence, the obese South American is leaning on a cane and\nsigning autographs for a whole mix of people, all of whom\nseem bewitched by their hero.

Then,\nfor no apparent reason - she must have gotten nervous - she\nstarts biting her fingernails, practically devouring them.\nAfter a while, the mother apparently tells her to stop,\nbecause she gets all pissed off, screams at her mother, then\ngets up and storms off.\n\nJimmy, an unlit cigarette dangling from his lips, studies her\nlike an entomologist.\n\nThe South American, leaning on his cane and his wife, is\ncoming across the garden.

Her husband has followed the whole thing, a\nsevere, jealous expression on his face.\n\nThe hippy mountaineer, sad and solitary, watches the swing\nband and sips his herbal tea. It’s so hot it burns his lips.\nHe lets out a quick but intense groan, which no one hears.\nMick and Fred give in to a brief, tragic exchange.\n\nMICK BOYLE\nToday?\n\f32.\n\nFRED BALLINGER\nNothing today. You?\n\nMICK BOYLE\nNothing.\n\nFRED BALLINGER\nLet’s hope we can piss tomorrow.\n\nWith enormous effort, the obese South American makes his way\nto the center of the dance floor, leaning on his cane. He\nsmiles and holds out his hand, inviting his wife to dance.\nShe beams and runs to join him. They dance for all of ten\nseconds, during which he struggles against his own body, his\nlegs ruined by his weight. Then he stops, completely\nexhausted. His companion grows anxious and gestures for\nassistance. Two dutiful waiters carry a chair onto the dance\nfloor, and the South American collapses in it, as if finally\nable to breathe again.\n\nEveryone observes the happenings with a grave air.\n\nFred and Mick watch as well. Fred blows his nose in his\nritual fashion. Mick, referring to the South American, says:\n\nMICK BOYLE\nThat man is the last true authentic\nmyth on the face of the planet.\nLike in ancient Greece.

DAY\n\nAdolf Hitler, in military uniform, is attempting to strut\nacross the garden, beneath a long canopy. He manages in part\nthanks to the briarwood cane. His steps are short, uncertain:\nin other words, an older Hitler, in his sixties, full of\naches and pains.\n\nHe marches past the camera. It’s not Hitler, it’s Jimmy Tree,\nin a perfect character reconstruction.\n\nHe walks slowly, almost prudently, but with an austere,\ndictatorial demeanor that erases the distinction between\nJimmy's character and the real Hitler. He looks around, but\nno one’s there.\n\nThen, all of a sudden, Hitler stops. He puts his palm on his\nforehead to smooth down his hair, just as Mick Boyle does all\nthe time, and then, with a certain pomposity, gives the Nazi\nsalute.\n\nHe has saluted Frances, the pale thirteen-year-old girl who\nstands before him.

Then he takes a candy\nfrom his pocket, unwraps it, and pops it in his mouth.\n\nHe tries again to turn toward his wife, who is still there,\nfar away, behind the glass, as if she were watching him\ninstead of merely staring at nothing. But once again, Fred\ndoesn’t have the courage to look her in the face. He holds\nthe candy wrapper between his fingers, but this time he\ndoesn’t rub it. He throws it in the canal in front of him.\n\nTired and tested, Fred reflects. And as he does so, ina\nclose up shot, the violin from “Simple Song No.3” begins to\nsound, but this time, we sense right away, it is played by a\nviolin virtuoso, not a boy just starting out.\n\n71. INT. THEATER. EVENING\n\nAbsolute silence, two empty chairs with gold trim.\n\nAn elegantly dressed audience has filled the theater.\nWithout warning, without any signal, the entire audience\nrises to its feet in eerie silence. Two individuals have\nentered the theater. We catch a glimpse of them through the\nbackdrop of people. Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip.\n\nThey sit in the gold trimmed chairs. We see their royal\noutlines backlit by the lights of the stage.\n\f109.\n\nThe audience can sit down again.\n\nA violin virtuoso plays the opening bars of “Simple Song\nNo.3”. Adagio, moderate volume.\n\nPrince Philip, in a backlit shot, his eyes full of joy,\nexpectant and excited. The eyes of a child.\n\nOn the stage, the great South Korean soprano, Sumi Jo,\nswallows secretly, overcome with panic and emotion. She gets\nready to sing.\n\nBacklit, Queen Elizabeth glances at her consort and is happy.\n\nThe Queen’s emissary, in the back of a box, observes from\nafar the happy Queen and Prince Philip, but he is still a\nball of tension.",

She looks at him.\n\nWe know they will kiss, but not now.\n\nThe camera zooms out.\n\f110.\n\nLena and the mountaineer are hanging in mid-air at ten\nthousand feet. Nothing below them.

Just the violin now.\n\nFred looks at Sumi Jo. He signals with his eyes for her to\ncome in.\n\nSumi Jo opens her mouth again, another clamorous, long,\nperfect high note.\n\nFred can’t help but stare at the Japanese soprano as she\ndelivers that extraordinary sound.\n\nAnd she looks at him.\n\nFred keeps looking at her, but it’s as if he is seeing\nsomeone else...\n\n74.
