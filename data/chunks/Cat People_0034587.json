These move\n\n               closer until we see that they are a pair of cat's eyes.  Over\n\n               these mysteriously blinking lights the title is SUPERIMPOSED.\n\n               DISSOLVE\n\n\n\n               A misty OUT-OF-FOCUS SHOT of a black panther pacing behind\n\n               cage bars.  Over this come the production credits. A pale\n\n               fog rises over the shot of the black panther, and over it\n\n               Is SUPERIMPOSED the following quotation:\n\n\n\n               EVEN AS FOG CONTINUES TO LIE IN THE VALLEYS, SO DOES ANCIENT\n\n               SIN CLING TO THE LOW PLACES, THE DEPRESSIONS IN THE WORLD\n\n               CONSCIOUSNESS.\n\n\n\n               SIGMUND FREUD\n\n\n\n               EXT.

Over\n\n               the scene is the wheezy music of the Triumphal March from\n\n               \"Aida,\" as played on a hand, organ. This is playing in the\n\n               distance, and we do not see the organ-grinder until later.\n\n\n\n               The CAMERA DRAWS BACK to show a young artist sitting before\n\n               the cage on a campstool with a drawing portfolio in her hand. \n\n               She is presumably sketching the panther, although her drawing\n\n               is not shown, and we do not see the features of the girl's\n\n               face.  The girl picks up the drawing and holds it off,\n\n               weighing its values. It evidently does not meet with her\n\n               approval, for she wads the drawing Into a ball and turns to\n\n               look for a place to throw the waste paper. We see her face.\n\n               It is heart-shaped, demure, even a little naive.  She is\n\n               small, young,and very beautiful.",

Because of the dim light in the room\n\n               they can barely be seen. Oliver is listening to her sing. She\n\n               ends her song, and they sit quietly for a moment.

In\n\n               the other corner, under the wide window, are a drawing board\n\n               and a desk, littered with crayons, brushes, bottles of\n\n               discolored water, and papers.  On one side of the wall, in\n\n               neat frames, hang three of Grandville's amusing studies of\n\n               cats dressed as humans. Over the mantel hangs a beautiful\n\n               reproduction of Goya's sinister portrait of Don Manuel Osorio\n\n               do Zunlga and the cats.

DRAFTING OFFICE - MORNING\n\n\n\n               WIDE VIEW. The Consolidated Ship and Barge Construction\n\n               Company has a handsome drafting office. Severe and modern,\n\n               it is nevertheless a room that immediately suggests\n\n               shipbuilding. A wide doorway opens in from the hall, in the\n\n               f.g. are three draftsmen's tables, glass-topped and lighted\n\n               from beneath. Behind them are several tables for other\n\n               workers. There are a number of rows of filing cabinets, and\n\n               at one side is a water cooler. The back wall of the office\n\n               is unadorned, wide, and slightly curving. At the moment, a\n\n               group of office workers are just starting to paste up the\n\n               sectional plans of a ship, entitled \"PROJECT NO. 457,\" on\n\n               this wall. The ship's bow can be seen taking form in\n\n               detailed constructional profile. \n\n\n\n               Two of the three draftsmen's tables in the f.g. are now\n\n               occupied. Oliver sits working at one of them.\n\n               The center one is unoccupied. At the other one, a tall,\n\n               lean Englishman works. This is James Carver. At the back\n\n               wall, Alice Moore is supervising two workers, who are doing\n\n               the actual pasting. She holds in her hands a small sheet of\n\n               paper with the detailed mathematical measurements of the\n\n               project,\n\n\n\n               Beside her, Commodore Judson, head of the Consolidated Ship\n\n               and Barge Construction Company, stands watching the beginning\n\n               of the project with genuine delight. He is a bald, bearded\n\n               gentleman and would look like an amiable tramp rather than\n\n               the head of a successful shipbuilding company, if it were not\n\n               for the seamanlike neatness of his clothes.\n\n\n\n                                   ALICE\n\n                             (motioning to one of the\n\n                              men at the wall)\n\n                         A little more to the left, Harry.\n\n                         Easy...just a hair... \n\n\n\n               She lifts her hand to indicate that it's in position.",

She picks up a sheet of paper from the desk and is\n\n               just about to return to the wall, when she is stopped by\n\n               the sound of a cat's mewing. She listens. The mew is\n\n               repeated. Carver raises his head and also listens. Alice\n\n               takes a look at the floor under and around her desk, \n\n               Oliver is still bending over his work, Alice looks\n\n               suspiciously and questioningly at Carver, Carver replies by\n\n               throwing his hands out to show that he doesn't know,and\n\n               then pointing to himself and shaking his head to announce\n\n               that the mew is not coming from him. The mewing continues\n\n               during this, which is one reason Carver and Alice do not\n\n               speak. They are listening. Alice and Carver both turn and\n\n               look at Oliver, He knows very well that they are looking at\n\n               him, and his pose is one of elaborate innocence.

His consulting room is clean,\n\n               antiseptic, and sparsely furnished with a couch, a chair, and\n\n               a gooseneck lamp on a stand.

As she gets around in front of Oliver, she\n\n               looks up, brushing the hair out of her eyes. A lighted\n\n               cigarette, with a long ash dangles from one corner of her\n\n               mouth.  She picks up her bucket and scrubbing brush and\n\n               starts to move out of Oliver's way.\n\n\n\n                                   MRS.

Only the\n\n               empty dessert plates and the empty demitasse cups remain. The\n\n               fire is burning bright, but low. Above the mantle is an empty\n\n               space. The Goya has been removed. Later, as the CAMERA\n\n               SHIFTS, we will notice that the Grandville drawings and the\n\n               panther screen have also been taken away.

They start running back. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n               CLOSE SHOT of the dead panther of the policeman's flashlight.\n\n\n\n               We see it in the beam\n\n\n\n               EXT. PANTHER CAGE - PARK - NIGHT\n\n\n\n               Oliver and Alice come to a little space before the cage. They\n\n               see a black object lying on the pavement.  Quietly and\n\n               cautiously they cross over to it.  Oliver bends down to\n\n               examine it. Under Irena's fur coat is a black leopard's body,\n\n               the leg and paw in the same attitude her arm and hand had\n\n               taken, and the broken blade that had once protruded from\n\n               Irena's gleaming shoulder is now rooted in the black fur of\n\n               the panther.  \n\n\n\n               Oliver looks up at Alice, then gets to his feet, takes her\n\n               arm, and they start to the walk.  Some few foot away, they\n\n               turn back to look again at the body.\n\n\n\n                                   OLIVER\n\n                             (softly )\n\n                         Poor Irena.\n\n\n\n               They turn off and walk away, arm in arm.  They are lost to\n\n               view in the foggy luminosity under a street lamp.\n\n\n\n               THE END\n\n"
