No music; only\nthe faint sounds of his car motor and those of two widely\nseparated vehicles he passes which are going in the opposite\ndirection. Titles end.\n\nMOVING SHOT - MANN'S CAR 2\n\nCamera drawing straight ahead of the car as it is driven along\nthe curving back country highway.

There is sunlight on his left arm and on part of\nhis lap. His hair is ruffled by the wind from the open window\nat his left. He is humming softly with the music on the car\nradio, the fingers of his right hand tapping idly on the steer-\ning wheel. Camera draws around him slowly, revealing a curv-\ning grade ahead between two high hills. Just visible, climbing\nthe grade, is a truck pulling a tank trailer. Camera moves down\nto the speedometer, Mann is holding his speed at a steady 55\nmiles per hour. After several moments, camera pans to the\ndashboard clock and holds.

Now the camera starts to pull ahead, drawing around so that\nMann's car remains in sight. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n After a while, the truck is re-\nvealed foot by foot; a gigantic gasoline tanker truck pulling\na tank trailer, each of them having six wheels. It is not a\nnew rig but dented and in need of renovation, its tanks painted\na cheap looking silver color. We hear the grinding strain of\nthe truck's motor. The vertical pipe to the left of the cab\nis spewing dark smoke which clouds back across the trailer.\nMann's car starts to close in on the truck and trailer.\n\fdde\n\n#34111 2\n\nINT, CAR ~ ANGLE PAST MANN 5\n\nThe truck trailer ahead, the distance between it and the\n\ncar narrowing. The word flammable is printed across the back\nof the trailer, red letters on a white background. There\nare parallel reflector lines across the bottom half of the\ntank which look as though they have been clumsily applied\nwith a stencil. Swaying behind the rear tires are massive,\nblack rubber flaps. The license plate is a California issue.\n\nMann starts to edge his car toward the opposite lane. He\nsteers back behind the truck with a faint sound of aggravation\nas he sees a blind curve ahead. Some of the dark exhaust.\nclouds across his car and he gets a whiff of it through the\nopen window, makes another sound, this one of distaste.\n\nAfter several moments, he edges out into the opposite lane\nagain. The ridge ahead makes it too risky to pass. Mann makes\nanother sound, this of semi-amused acceptance as he pulls\nbehind the truck again.\n\nHELICOPTER SHOT - TRUCK AND CAR 6\n\nThe truckireaches the summit of the ridge and moves across it.\nAfter a brief period, it starts around a left curve on the\ndowngrade. Camera draws around to reveal that no cars are\napproaching from the other direction. Immediately, Mann's car\nis accelerated and steered into the opposite lane, gradually\npassing the truck.\n\nINT.
