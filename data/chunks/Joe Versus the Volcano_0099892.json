It's an ugly\nbuilding about the size of a city block and a couple of\nstories high.  It's surrounded by hurricane fence topped\nwith barbed wire.  Outside the fence is a muddy parking\nlot.

There's a guard at a gate\nnodding workers inside the fence.  They trail listlessly\npast him and continue on their way to the building's\nentrance.  Most of them carry or are using grey or black\numbrellas.  Since they are coming from the parking lot,\nand since the entrance to the building is still almost a\ncity block away once inside the fence, this straggling\nline of workers stretches hundreds of yards.  Some of the\nworkers wear hats.\n\nWe see the line of workers FROM HIGH OVERHEAD\n\nThe line is in the same shape as the lightning bolt logo.\n\nOne of these workers is JOE BANKS.  Joe is in his early\nthirties.  He's wearing a beat-up black trench coat;\nunder the trench coat he's got on a cheap and square\njacket and tie.  This is a depressed man.

PANASCOPE BUILDING - DAY\t\t\t\t\t\t2\n\nJoe is shuffling down the main walk in the building.  On\nhis left are doors leading to offices.  On his right is\nthe factory, which has the feel of an airplane hangar.\nThe factory is separated from the walk on which Joe\nprogresses by a heavy wire fence twelve feet high.  Joe\npasses by a sign on this fence that says \"Shipping.\" This\narea is filled with thousands of brown cardboard boxes; a\nshipping clerk among these boxes pulls a lever on a\ndevice; the device spews out several feet of wet brown\ntape.  Joe continues on.  He passes a sign on the fence\nthat says \"Canteen.\"  This area contains a row of vending\nmachines and two long tables; a guy who looks like he's\ngoing to die is sitting at one of the tables eating pink\nHostess snowballs; he eats them in a slow, dismal way, as\nif they were giant sleeping pills.  Joe continues on.  He\npasses a sign on the fence that says \"Quality Control.\"\nThis is the biggest area; it's filled with workers in\nshower caps and worn white jackets; they work a distance\napart from each other, at long tables; they are\ninspecting terrifying medical instruments.  One of these\nworkers, a middle-aged woman named Sally, attaches a\ncatheter to an air pump.  The catheter inflates and\nfinally explodes.  Sally seems satisfied.  Joe continues\non, his shoe distantly SQUISHING.  He stops at one of the\noffice doors on his left. The lettering on the door\nreads:\n\n\t ADVERTISING DEPARTMENT\n\nJoe opens the door and goes in.

Her makeup doesn't\nreally work under these lights.  She nods briefly to Joe,\nand goes on with her typing.  Joe tries to hang up his\nhat, but it keeps falling off the hook.  He is endlessly\npatient.  It's the sound of the typewriter that makes him\nmiss.  At last he succeeds.  Behind Dede, at a bigger\ndesk, is MR. WATURI.  He's leaning back in an executive\nchair, talking on the phone.  He's middle-aged, olive\nskinned, in a dark suit that shows up his significant\ndandruff.  His teeth are yellow as rancid butter.  And\nthere's enough grease shining on his forehead to coat a\nskillet.  He's talking into the phone.\n\n\t\t\t  WATURI\n\tYeah, Harry, but can he do the\n\tjob?

There's a small wooden\ndesk which has on it an old electric typewriter and an\nout-of-place lamp; it's a lamp Joe brought from home. The\nrest of the office is almost entirely taken up with grey\nindustrial shelving.  On these shelves are brochures\ndepicting various medical instruments.  Samples of each\nbrochure are taped to the appropriate shelf.

Joe turns on the lamp, which casts a small\nring of golden light, and sits down with his coffee.  He\ntakes off his shoe and examines it.
