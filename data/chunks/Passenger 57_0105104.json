Capable-looking.  Sharp, chiseled features. But it's the eyes that grab you.  They're the coldest, crudest eyes you've ever seen and they belong to CHARLES RANE, known in the terrorism trade as \"Wolfgang.\"  On the Interpol Hit Parade, Wolfgang is number one with a bullet.\n\nDR. BAUMAN (O.S.)\n\nClose, please.\n\nWolfgang closes his eyes.  A felt-tip pen ENTERS FRAME and begins to make precise marks on Wolfgang's features. These are the marks of a skilled plastic surgeon, mapping out the operation he intends to perform.  Everything about Wolfgang's face will change.\n\nDR. BAUMAN (O.S.)\n\nOpen.\n\nWolfgang opens his eyes.  No amount of surgery can change them.  They remain cold, cruel and penetrating.\n\nDR. BAUMAN (O.S.)\n\nWell?\n\nA mirror ENTERS FRAME.  Wolfgang smiles at his marked-up image, eyes gleaming with wicked pleasure.  This is one scary guy.\n\nWOLFGANG\n\nI think I'm going to like the new me.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n2      INT.

Then -- BOOM! --a big overhead light comes on, illuminating Wolfgang who reclines in a custom operating chair surrounded by gleaming high-tech equipment and a surgical team headed by DR. MICHAEL BAUMAN, the Florida Gulf coast's foremost plastic surgeon.\n\nDr. Bauman looks at the wall clock.  Two minutes 'til noon.  Bauman wipes some sweat from his lip and adjusts his surgical mask.\n\nBAUMAN \n\nSedate the patient.\n\nAn enter TANK HISSES to life.\n\n3      EXT.",

The work I have to do -- the pain involved --\n\nPain is Wolfgang's favorite word.  He smiles his Death's Head smile.\n\nWOLFGANG \n\nPain is something I've learned to live with.\n\nIt's all there in Wolfgang's eyes.  Not just pain but the pleasure of pain.  Wolfgang can't wait for Bauman to cut into him!  Bauman realizes he's dealing with one weird motherfucker and wisely decides to humor him.\n\nBAUMAN \n\nAll right.  Let's proceed.\n\nA scrub nurse presents an operating tray to Bauman.  On it are an assortment of strange scalpels and instruments. Bauman shoots a nervous look at the clock -- thirty seconds 'til noon -- and selects a wicked-looking scalpel.\n\n7      CORRIDOR                                                 7\n\nSWAT commandos converge on the door marked \"Surgery.\"\n\n8      SURGERY                                                  8\n\nBauman bends over Wolfgang.  He brings up the scalpel, his hand shaking ever so slightly.  A drop of sweat falls from Bauman's forehead and lands on Wolfgang's lower lip.  Wolfgang's tongue darts out and licks it away.\n\nBauman and Wolfgang lock eyes.  Wolfgang knows that Bauman has set him up.\n\nWOLFGANG \n\nThe patient lived.

At the end of the corridor is an elevator -- its doors have begun to separate.  It's Wolfgang's only chance.\n\nWolfgang races for the elevator, bare feet slapping marble.  He's halfway there when the elevator doors slide open to reveal a second team of SWAT cops.  They spill out with weapons drawn, ready to open fire.\n\nWolfgang puts on the brakes.  The first SWAT team arrives from behind and Wolfgang is caught in the middle.  One false move and he gets fragged from both directions.  Oh, well.  With a shrug of indifference, Wolfgang raises his hands over his head.\n\nSWAT OFFICER \n\nYou're under arrest!\n\nThe smile on Wolfgang's face seems to say, \"Temporarily.\" Wolfgang begins to whistle \"Pack Up Your Troubles\" as SWAT cops rush forward to cuff him.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n13     EXT.

He's alone in his own bedroom, bathed in the blue glow of a TV test pattern.  Cutter runs a hand through his damp hair.  He's a black man in his late 20s -- handsome and muscular --but unable to shake the nightmare that has haunted him for two years.\n\nCUTTER \n\n(under his breath)\n\nI gotta get some new dreams.\n\nANGLE WIDENS.\n\nThe room is pretty much bare.  Bed, nightstand and a Solo-flex exercise set-up.  Cutter is a man of few possessions.  The walls are covered with a variety of bulls-eyes and target silhouettes -- the kind used by law enforcement.  Each one is expensively framed -- Cutter's idea of art.\n\nThe ALARM GOES OFF AGAIN.\n\nCUTTER \n\nI heard you the first time.\n\nCutter SHUTS OFF the ALARM and climbs out of bed.

The Attorney, wiping spit off his expensive suit with a handkerchief, shows the indifferent guard some papers.  The guard wheels open the heavy iron door.\n\nCAMERA FOLLOWS the Attorney into a small dark room. The iron DOOR CLANGS shut behind him.  On the other side of a mesh screen sits Wolfgang, stripped naked, wearing handcuffs.  His body is hard and muscular, a map of ugly scars.

As Wolfgang and Cutter know, children make the best hostages. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\nCUTTER\n\nNo. . .\n\nBut Wolfgang is already running for the carousel.  Cutter takes off after him.  He's got Fiona's gun but there's no way he can take a shot.  Too many people.\n\nWolfgang collides with the ticket taker, knocking him down.\n\n149F   CAROUSEL                                                 149F\n\nRound and round go the colorful carved horses and their merry young riders.  The MUSIC is LOUDER here.  It seems almost demented.  Suddenly Wolfgang is on board -- a wolf among sheep, seeking a victim.  He zeroes in on a five-year-old boy astride a bucking bronco.\n\nWolfgang grabs the child by the back of his T-shirt, lifts him out of the saddle.  In the center ring, the ride operator sees Wolfgang, the child and Wolfgang's gun.  Terrified, he panics and yanks the brake -- too fast.\n\nThe sudden braking is too much for the over-taxed MOTOR. It BLOWS.  Gears fly apart, showering sparks.  The carousel begins to spin out of control, shimmying and shaking.  Children scream and cling to their horses for dear life.\n\n149G   CROWD                                                    149G\n\nIt watches in horror.  Cutter pushes through the throng and races to the madly spinning carousel.  He throws himself on board and smashes into a horse.  He bounces off, crashes into another horse and is knocked around like a pinball.\n\nANGLE\n\nWolfgang is thrown forward against a pole.  He loses his grip on the boy who drops to the spinning platform and rolls toward the edge.  The ground beyond is a dangerous blur.  The boy is just about to roll off when Cutter dives INTO FRAME.  He grabs the boy just in time and pulls him back to safely.\n\nCUTTER \n\n(to the terrified boy) \n\nYou're okay.\n\nWOLFGANG \n\nYou should've let him fall.\n\nWolfgang is now standing over them, one hand clinging to a striped pole for support, the other clutching the gun -- aimed at Cutter and the boy.  Cutter cocks his leg and kicks the pole Wolfgang is using for support. The pole splinters and Wolfgang loses his balance.  He falls off the ride.\n\nANGLE\n\nWolfgang hits the ground and rolls for several yards. The gun flies out of his hand.",
