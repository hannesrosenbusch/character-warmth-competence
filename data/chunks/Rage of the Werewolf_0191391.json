A sort of unbalance between\n\nhuman and animal, if you will. The shifting of the moon´s orbit five years ago     has accelerated this dormant gene. Just as the full moon changes the tides and some emotions in people, its influence has now increased to dangerous proportions.\n\n                                               ANCHOR\n\nThank you, Professor.

He was out gathering wood in the mountains outside a small town in Italy. He said a beast in man´s clothing attacked him—a werewolf. \n\nCUT TO: FLASHBACK SCENE where he gets attacked.\n\n                                                                                                          JAKE\n\n                                                                              The beast would have killed him if not for an arrow shot by a nearby hunter. For some reason, my father was unaffected, but two of the three children he later had were—my older brother and I. My sister was spared the horrible curse. Laslo and I didn´t feel the effects of the curse until we reached our late teens. One night during a full moon it happened…\n\nCUT TO FLASHBACK SCENE—where he is changing.\n\n                                                                                                                     JAKE\n\n                                                                                At that time, before the change in the moon´s orbit, I had no control over the beast inside me, I couldn´t change at will, only when there was a full moon—like with you. After the many deaths my brother and I committed the townspeople began to suspect my father, having heard the story from the hunter who saved him from the wolf. My parents, my younger sister, were burned alive in our very home. My uncle saw Lazlo and I get to safety by sending us to America. So that´s it, that´s the story.\n\n                                                                                                                       GINA\n\n                                                                              And that´s why regular bullets can´t hurt you?\n\n                                                                                                                        JAKE\n\n                                                                              I guess only silver bullets can, though I´ve never been shot by one, so I can´t say for sure…\n\n                                                                                                                         GINA\n\n                                                                              So all those old werewolf legends are true?\n\n                                                                                                                         RALPH\n\n                                                                       Cursed werewolves, bloodsucking vampires and evil demons—they all exist.

They get away and head back for their apartment. Outside, from behind some bushes, they see police men walking around, asking questions to people. They find out from a street person , CHARLIE, that someone was murdered outside of Jake´s apartment and they´re looking for him. They find the hobo in a nearby alleyway, getting drunk as usual.

Jake follows… \n\nThe two walk until they come to a room with a jail cell in it.  The crosses and bulbs of garlic hang from the bars. This is where KESSA has been kept.

The change is dramatic, the most dramatic transformation we have seen yet. He smiles, evilly, as he growls, getting into the pain of the change. His eyes turn yellow, his clothes rip as fur  appears across his forearms. His teeth grow extra long, saliva pouring out his gaping mouth. His ears grow long and pointy. \n\nWhile this is going on KESSA gets Jake´s attention.\n\n                                                                                                KESSA\n\n                                                                Get me out of here now and I promise you´ll be spared.\n\nHe turns from her to his brother, who is midway changed.

Grateful? You´ve made it worse!!!\n\nJAKE lunges at his brother, renewing the battle.\n\nWhile they fight, Kessa has managed to get out of her cell. She spots the duffel bag dropped by JAKE and picks it up. She too is starting to transform but not as severe as the brothers. She now has fangs and some fur on her face and claws. \n\nJAKE has now jumped on Lazlo´s back.\n\n                                                                                JAKE (VO)\n\n                                                Forgive me, brother…\n\nAnd with a weird, savage growl that is a mixture of wolf and bat, Jake rips off his brother´s head. There is a lot of blood shooting out and the head rolls to the end of the room, bouncing off the wall. Lazlo´s headless body tears Jake off and tosses him to the side of the room, where he lands on all fours and growls like a savage animal. It´s here that JAKE sees the mangled body of RALPH on the ground. He is shocked—but not as shocked as he is to see the decapitated head of Lazlo (now human) staring up at him and talking. Meanwhile, Lazlo´s headless body, still wolflike, is slowly picking itself up off the floor.\n\n                                                                                LAZLO\n\n                                                Don´t look so sad, Jake.",

She fires at the headless body several times. The impact of the bullets push the body back but it does not kill it. Strangely, the head of Lazlo winces with slight pain with each bullet shot.\n\nThe body turns around to “face” her. This gives JAKE enough time to get to his feet. KESSA looks at the Lazlo creature,then at JAKE—and gestures with her head that he should do something. She fires more bullets and this time Lazlo´s head makes a sound. This gives JAKE an idea. \n\nHe reaches over and grabs Lazlo´s head—and runs into the other room with it, where the jail cell is. \n\n                                                                                LAZLO\n\n                                                What are you doing?\n\nIn the other room the Lazlo body is fumbling around without eyesight to direct it. It is blind. Kessa steps around it and kicks it in the ass as he darts into the other room after JAKE.\n\nJAKE has now returned more to his human form, though he still has werewolf teeth and eyes.\n\n                                                                                JAKE\n\n                                                What should I do?\n\n                                                                                KESSA\n\n                                                We have to separate his head from his body permanently, so he\n\n                                                Can´t reform.—here—\n\nShe takes the head from Jake´s grasp and throws the screaming head into her coffin.\n\n                                                                                JAKE\n\n                                                Now what?\n\n                                                                                KESSA\n\n                                                We have to fill the coffin with garlic and other religious artifacts—\n\n                                                The stuf f on the floor—\n\nJake places reaches into his shirt and reveals the cross and chain given to him by his mother—we see it has burned a mark into his chest. He then rips it off and places it  into the box with Lazlo´s head. It makes Jake´s hand smoke and is in pain, confused. A sideeffect of Lazlo´s “gift”.  Kessa flips the lid over as Lazlo screams out—\n\n                                                                                LAZLO\n\n                                                No, don´t.",

We see the numbers clicking by. A countdown. It is feeling against the wall for the entrace to the jail cell room, trying to find them. But without Lazlo´s line of sight it is hard.\n\n                                                                                KESSA\n\n                                                You´ll see—\n\nThey scramble up the stairs—but a hand grabs her leg. She kicks it off and they continue up to outside—they run out and pause a distance away.\n\nINT. BASEMENT\n\nBy now the werewolf body has found the head and takes it out of the box—placing it back on its shoulders. This is when Lazlo feels—and then sees-- the grenade stuffed in his pants. He explodes.\n\nEXT. HOUSE—\n\nThere is the sound of an explosion and some flames.\n\nBoth Kessa and Jake stand and watch for a moment, before they continue. The sounds of approaching crowd—Lazlo´s followers—is heard.\n\nEXT. CITY—\n\nThey are running down the street—Kessa pulls on his arm.
