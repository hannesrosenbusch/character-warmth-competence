O. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n (CONT'D)\nA week or so after The Network\npulled out, they just sort of\nrebooted by themselves.\n\nWe see blackened figures in the burnt out catacombs come to\nlife. The blanks awake. Peter blinks. Oliver sits up to\ndiscover that his head is missing once again. He frowns.\n\nANDY (V.0O.)\nThey seemed lost at first, children\ncut off from their parents. I felt\na bit sorry for them to be honest.\n\nThe blanks stumble through society. Some are pelted with\ntomatoes. Some reunite with tearful relatives. Oliver passes\ngraffiti reading ‘WE ARE NOT ROBOTS’. He gets dirty looks\nfrom passersby. He gives them the finger, mouths “fuck off”.\n\nANDY (V.0O.)\nThe Network was right about one\nthing. We don’t play nice with\nothers. The Network was right about\na few things to be fair. Oliver\nwent back to being an estate agent.\nPeople still need a roof over their\nheads and the old Olly always had a\ngift for the gab. I guess the new\none has too.\n\nOliver, now wearing half a football in place of his missing\nhead, shows a young couple into a rough dwelling.\n\nHe attempts to follow them but bumps into the door jamb.\n\nANDY (V.0O.)\nI hear the Petertron went home. He\nremembered enough to know where\nBishop’s Gardens was. I suppose he\njust picked up where he left off.\n\nWe see Peter approach his now overgrown and half-shuttered\nhouse in Bishop’s Gardens.\n\nANDY (V.0O.)\nI’m not sure his wife noticed.\nMaybe she chose not to. He’s a\npretty good dad by all accounts.\n\nWe see Peter sat round the breakfast table with his kids ina\nburnt out kitchen. He takes off his hand and lets it scuttle\nround the table. Everyone laughs. His wife enters, Peter\nquickly reattaches his hand and winks at his children.\n\n(CONTINUED)\n\f125.\nCONTINUED: (2)\n\nANDY (V.0O.)\nSteven and Sam got together in the\nend.

It’s a pretty nice shack too. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\nSam and Steven appear on the doorstep of an impressive\nlooking shack. Sam kisses Steven who slings a shotgun over\nhis shoulder and strides off, presumably to go hunting.\n\nANDY (V.0O.)\nAs for Gary?\n\nAndy looks ruefully into the distance as he remembers his old\nfriend, almost forgetting he is addressing the group.\n\nANDY\nI don’t know what happened to Gary.\nWe got separated and I never saw\nhim again. Some say he went back to\nNewton Haven. I don’t know why, I\nthink his business there was done.\n\nEXT. NEW ANGLIA - DAY\n\nWe see Gary, striding out of the smoke, still dressed in his\ntrench coat, which seems somehow more befitting in these\nsurroundings. He carries a broadsword on his back.\n\nANDY (V.0O.)\nWherever he is, I hope he’s happy.\nIt’s funny but I miss him. I wonder\nif he misses me.\n\nStriding behind him, the BLANK TEENAGE VERSIONS OF ANDY,\nSTEVEN, OLIVER AND PETER. They are somewhat blackened, with\nmodifications to their garb. They too carry medieval weapons.\n\nGary leads them to a pub that stands alone in the smoky\napocalyptic wasteland: ‘THE RISING SUN’\n\nHe brings them to a halt at the door of the pub and regards\nthe sign made out of number plates. It reads ‘NO BL4 NKS’.\nINT. THE RISING SUN - DAY\n\nThe sign clatters across the pub floor drawing looks from the\ngroup of armed, rough-looking and very human patrons.\n\nHUMAN PATRON 1\nBlank bastards.\n\n(CONTINUED)\n\f126.\nCONTINUED:\n\nHUMAN PATRON 2\nFucking robots.\n\nGary and his gang of blanks approach the bar and a publican\nwho eyes them with absolute disdain.\n\nGARY\nFive waters please.\n\nPUBLICAN 13\nYou can have one but I'm not\nserving this scum.\n\nGary notes the air of tension in the room and smiles.\n\nGARY\nWell I'm afraid it's all for one\nand one for all.

With lightning speed, Gary draws his sword and his\nwingmen fall into combat formation behind him.\n\nPUBLICAN 13\nWho the hell do you think you are?\n\nGARY\nMe?\n\nBehind Gary, the eyes of his blank posse switch on and GLOW\nBRIGHTLY, backlighting Gary's final, badass line.\n\nGARY\nThey call me The King.\n\nGary charges at the camera. Things are about to get messy.\n\f"
