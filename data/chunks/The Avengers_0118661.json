  "87": "END OF PREVIOUSLY ANNOTATED SECTION:\nPOPS a CHAMPAGNE CORK. From a tent, he brings two glasses down the \nbeach to\n\n363TWO DIVAN-STYLE DECK CHAIRS\n\nWhere Steed and Emma toast in the sun. Steed in a smoking jacket, Emma \nin a bikini. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\n\t\t\t\t\tEMMA\n\t\t\tI don't recall Siberia being this\n\t\t\twarm, Steed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSTEED\n\t\t\tIt's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEMMA\n\t\t\tOur little paradise -- just made\n\t\t\tfor two?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSTEED\n\t\t\t\t(looks; frowns)\n\t\t\tNot quite.\n\nOn cue from the water, Mother emerges, snorkeling in his wheelchair \ncontraption -- with Brenda.

A little more\n\t\t\tice, I think ...\n\nTrubshaw trots off dutifully.  A large ice bucket appears.  Mother \nmoves in.  Absorbed by Emma, now his new protegee.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMOTHER\n\t\t\tAbout your next assignment, Mrs.\n\t\t\tPeel ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEMMA\n\t\t\tNext assignment?\n\nSteed gives his champagne to the Siberian peasant.  He presses a switch \n-- an umbrella shoots up between them, opens up, twirls.\n\nPULL BACK to reveal the strip of beach, like a tiny bubble of tropical \nweather.  Against a Siberian b.g. of snow.  As we WIDEN we REVEAL a \ngiant glass bubble, hearing --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEMMA (V.O.)\n\t\t\tAh ... sun tan lotion. Any shops\n\t\t\tnearby?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSTEED (V.O.)\n\t\t\tMust be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll\n\t\t\tsend Mother ...\n\nPULL BACK to reveal no shop for miles around.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMOTHER (V.O.)\n\t\t\tAhem. As I was saying, perhaps\n\t\t\tanother macaroon ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEMMA (V.O.)\n\t\t\tThank you, Steed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSTEED (V.O.)\n\t\t\tThank you, Mrs. Peel.\n\nBehind the umbrella -- LAUGHTER.
