INT. - NIGHTMARE - RAILCAR - EVENING/NIGHT\n\nRUBEN BRANDT (45) is alone in the railcar, sitting by the\nwindow, reading a book. The monotonous clatter of the train\nis lulling him to sleep. He gets up and heads to the toilet\nthrough the empty hallway. The train goes into a tunnel. The\nhallway is dark. He goes in to the bathroom. He washes his\nhands while whistling.\n\nSuddenly, a little boy appears in the background. The boy\nwears breeches and a shirt, stands in the bathtub and stares\nRuben in the face.\n\nRuben wakes up in the railcar. Another boy (FRANK DUVENECK’S\nWHISTLING BOY, 8), holding a snail, is sitting in front of\nhim, stares straight into his eyes while whistling.\n\nA window abruptly falls open and a strong gust of wind slaps\nRuben in the face. Ruben is horrified; a little girl\n(VELAZQUEZ'S INFANTA MARGARITA, 7), is hanging outside the\nrailcar.\n\nRUBEN BRANDT\nHey!\n\nHer fingers can barely grasp the metal frame of the open\nwindow. She screams for help.\n\nINFANTA MARGARITA\n(shouts )\nHelp me! Help me!\n\nThe moment Ruben leaps over and catches the girl by her thin\nwrist she bites hard on Ruben's bare hand.\n\nRuben screams with pain, trying to pull his hand out of the\ngirl's mouth, but the girl is much stronger and she slowly\npulls him out of the train.\n\nRuben is struggling to no avail. He desperately turns his\nhead towards the boy, seeking help. The boy watches\nindifferently and keeps whistling his tune.\n\nOnly Ruben's feet remain in the railcar; but to his horror,\nhe notices the approaching lights of a locomotive on the\nopposite track. Ruben screams.\n\n0020. INT./EXT. - RUBEN BRANDT’S ROOM.",
