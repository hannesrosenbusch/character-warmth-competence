It’s close enough to feel.\n\nA FLASH OF LIGHT breaks through the fog, revealing...\n\nThe silhouette of a bleak stone island, no bigger than an\nacre: PILOT ROCK. A few ramshackle outbuildings cling to the\nsurface like barnacles. On the highest point of the island\nstands a tall, crumbling LIGHTHOUSE TOWER. An ominous flock\nof SEAGULLS screech and caw around it.\n\nTHE FOGHORN and LIGHT bellow and flash again.\n\nTHE ISLAND itself seems to draw the boat and the men closer.\n\nEXT. PILOT ROCK.

A\npoorly mended DORY -- THE LIFE BOAT -- is tied up inside,\nsitting on the twisted runners of the launch that stretch out\ninto the lapping waves.\n\nEXT. PILOT ROCK. NEAR THE LIVING QUARTERS - SUNSET\n\nTWO OTHER MEN (late 60s, same uniforms) exit the one-story\nCLAPBOARD SHACK that adjoins THE LIGHTHOUSE by a remarkably\nlong breezeway. They are the departing LIGHTHOUSE KEEPERS --\n“WICKIES,” as they refer to themselves. They lug gunny sacks\nover their shoulders, and drag their rope-handled ditty boxes\nby their sides, keeping their heads down. Their bearded faces\nare craggy and leaden. They reek of tobacco, must, and salt.\nThey shuffle toward their relief: THE MEN FROM THE TENDER,\ncarrying their supplies.\n\nThe four almost exchange glances. But they don’t bother.\n\nTHE FOGHORN bellows.\n\nEXT. PILOT ROCK. NEAR THE LIVING QUARTERS - LATER\n\nThe new wickies stand utterly still, next to each other,\ntheir gazes fixed on the same distant spot.\n\nOne man is YOUNG (early 30s). Tall, athletic -- but starved.\nHis deep set eyes are haunted, and his left eye is healing\nfrom a week-old shiner. His crooked expression is severe.\nThere’s an eerie disquiet about him. He’s like a dog that’s\nbeen beaten and caged too many times. A small mustache shows\nhis vanity.\n\nThe other is OLD (Haggard 60? Spry 70?). He’s weathered,\nferal bearded, and hunched, with hands like vises. His lack\nof visible lips suggests some missing teeth. He tremors a\nbit, but he’s lean and sturdy as a lead pipe. His high\ncheekbones smile even when he grimaces. His wild eyes shine\nlike jewels. He’s an old Pan. A Satyr.",

IT SHAKES THE YOUNG MAN -\nshocks him - but not the OLD one. He’s used to it.\n\nOLD puts the stump of an unlit clay PIPE in his mouth (upside\ndown). He lumbers out of frame, limping a bit, and happy to\nfinally be “home again.”\n\nYOUNG stays standing, staring out. A bit of fear strikes him.\nThere’s no turning back now.\n\nINT. LIVING QUARTERS.

He looks around, shifty eyed, to be sure no\none is watching him...\n\nInstinctively, he passes his hand along the top of the desk\nto the LOCK. He jiggles it. Locked.
