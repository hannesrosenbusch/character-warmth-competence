I\nshould be a Slytherin.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nIt's true, Harry. You do possess\nmany of the qualities Voldemort\nhimself prizes. Resourcefulness.\nDetermination. A certain\ndisregard for the rules. Yet the\nSorting Hat placed you in\nGryffindor.\n\nHARRY\nOnly because I asked it to.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\n\nExactly. Which makes you very\ndifferent from Voldemort.
