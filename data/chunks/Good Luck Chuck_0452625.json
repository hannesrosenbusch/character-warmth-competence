CHILD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 119\n\n(Ex-Goth Girl) Anisha Carter kisses her daughter good night.\nShe walks toward her room as we hear the following in V.0O.:\n\nCAM (V.O.)\nI promise to sleep by your side, to\nwarm your body and heart, and to\nnurture your soul.

(cont'd)\nand most of all, I promise never to\nmake you live off your own fat.\n\nWe follow Anisha into her bedroom.

We continue to hear\nthe vows...\n\nCHARLIE (0.S8.)\nI promise to be your Gentoo. I\nwill wash your tears away with my\nkisses and never let you stray too\nfar away from my soul. I promise\nto be your safe haven in this life,\nto never take you for granted, but\nto always give you your space...\nespecially if you're tripping or\nwalking into doors. I love you.\n\nAs the vows come to a close, Anisha gently pulls an old\nelementary school photograph of Charlie out of an alter-like\nshrine (complete with a home-made heart with a pin through\nit, a cup with musty rain water and many “lucky” items, such\nas a horseshoe, a rabbit’s foot, a four-leaf clover, etc.).\n\nWith a satisfied smile, she starts to disassemble the shrine.\n\nEXT.

Most home-made tapes fall into the genre of\n“Porn-Horror”).\n\nAs the credits continue to roll, we see out-of-focus shots\nand incredibly embarrassing moments from Cam and Charlie’s\n“magical” night. The beautifully shot “movie” version was\nnothing close to what really happened. Some of the moments\ninclude:\n\n-- Having forgotten it was laundry day, Cam realizes (too\nlate) that she is wearing her “Granny panties”.\n\n-- At Cam’s urging, Charlie tries to “talk nasty” but has a\nhard time getting the hang of it (ie. “Ooo, yeah, bounce your\nboobs like a... bouncy... hippity hop... Wait, can I start\nover again?”)\n\n-- “Whoah, whoah, whoah... wrong hole.”\n\n-- Charlie trying to blame the “squeaky bed” for what was\nunquestionably flatulence.\n\n-- While reaching for lubrication (which spills EVERYWHERE\nand makes it difficult to hold the camera), Charlie discovers\nCam’s stash of a zillion sex toys.\n\f118.\n\n-- We see some CLOSE UP FOOTAGE of Cam and Charlie having sex\n(we hear them groaning in the background) that could easily\nbe footage of INTESTINAL SURGERY on the Discovery Channel.\nWhen we CUTAWAY to see Lara and Stu watching, they look to be\non the verge of getting sick.",

Uh-\nhuh. Do me sort of like that. Okay, I give up.”\n\n-- For the final shot, the camera is CLOSE on Charlie. It’s\nclear that Cam is on top of him and they are grinding\npassionately.
