And that’s\nsomething I never thought I’d see\nagain.\n\nLAUREL picks up a boot (the right one) with a large hole in\nthe sole. Using a knife he levers off the heel.\n\nLAUREL\nWhat’d she want?\n\nHARDY\nTwenty thousand bucks.\n\nLAUREL\nTwenty thousand?\n\nHARDY\nFifteen years of back alimony. I\nsaid ‘what alimony? When we broke\nup I gave you whatever money I had\nand you took the car.’ We both\nagreed that was that.\n\nLAUREL\nJeez even Mae wasn’t after that\nmuch - and she wanted me to pay for\na chauffeur.

COBH HARBOUR - DAY 109\n\nCaption\nCobh harbour, Ireland\n\nThe steamer heads into Cobh harbour, an old seaport on the\nsouthern coast of Ireland dominated by St. Coleman’s\nCathedral, towering over the quay from its hillside perch.\n\nWe see feet, small feet - some with no socks, just in clogs -\nrunning. We see CHILDREN emerging from street corners to make\ntheir way down to the quayside - where a crowd is gathering.\n\nEXT. STEAMER, DECK - DAY 110\n\nThe LAURELS and HARDYS make their way up out of the ship’s\ninterior on to the gangplank, LAUREL with two big cases and\nHARDY just a small valise (their old trick whenever they\narrive somewhere). But they stop as they look out at the\nquayside. We now...\n\nCUT TO:\n\n-what they see: a huge crowd of people of all ages has\ngathered to greet them, standing patiently, silently. IDA and\nLUCILLE drop back so that LAUREL and HARDY can walk down the\ngangplank together. Once the crowd sees them, the big guy and\nthe little guy from the movies, a great cheer erupts. As they\ndescend the gangplank hats are thrown in the air and the\ncrowd surges forward to greet them. Then, just as they reach\nthe bottom of the gangplank, something extraordinary happens.\nFrom the cathedral bells at the top of the hill, ‘The Dance\nOf The Cuckoos’ - the boys’ theme tune - is rung out from the\nbell tower. LAUREL and HARDY look at each other, unable to\nquite believe what is happening. They both weep openly,\namazed at the reception, at the warmth and love which engulfs\nthem.\n\nEXT.
