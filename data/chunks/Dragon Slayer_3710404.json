Upon a hill at\nthe edge of the wood squats a castle, its crude stonework\nbathed in cold silvery light. Queer carvings and runes\ndecorate the ponderous gate. Heavy vines are climbing up the\nwalls. The castle is old, its unfamiliar form testament to\n\nan ancient mind and an ancient craft. Flickering candle light\ndances ona leaded windowpane.\n\nInside, the corridors are dark and silent. Under low arched\nceilings the uneven floors are paved with stone blocks.\nPerched over lintels and crouched in niches are icons with\nstrange animal heads.\n\nHODGE\n\nAsleep ona straw palette in a room strewn with vegetables\nand crockery is Hodge, a wrinkled old retainer. A flickering\ncandle and empty jug are beside the bed. He is snoring gently.\n\nCONJURING ROOM\n\nThis circular chamber at the heart of the castle is stuffed\n\nwith parchments, scrolls, dusty books, bronze braziers, glass\nretorts, chemical salts, birds both stuffed and caged. An\n\niron candelabra stands on a work table, tapers burning. In\n\nthe soft glow it seems that the room is unoccupied, but no,\nmoving in the background is a shadowy figure, preparing for\na magical deed. Feet are positioned carefully within a\npentagram chiseled into the floor. A scroll is consulted; up\ncomes an arm and a voice blurts out:\n\nScript provided for educational purposes.

Here, more magic is afoot. An old\nenchanter, Ulrich, Magister Ipsissimus, pours water from a\nsilver ewer into a stone bowl. As the surface ripples\ndisappear he leans forward and gazes into the pool. All at\nonce his face hardens as the distant sounds of screams and\nthunder reach his ears. Lights and shadows, reflected from\nwithin the basin, play across his face. His frown deepens as\nthe sound of his own voice comes to him from the vision in\nthe water — Draco draconis — suddenly squelched by the\nroar of flame and an ugly snarl.\n\nAt that moment Galen reaches the top of the steps and holds\nup the candelabra.\n\nGALEN\nVide, Magister.
