On this ladder a gentleman with a cocked\n\n               hat pushed back on his wig sits reading. There are bins of\n\n               books on the sidewalk in front of the shop and counters\n\n               within. At the rear of the shop is a manually operated\n\n               printing press. The shop is fairly well filled with\n\n               customers; serious gentlemen who are looking at books,\n\n               discussing prints and indulging in political arguments. Sims\n\n               is standing near the printing press with a companion, a stout\n\n               gentleman who looks not unlike Dr. Samuel Johnson. The CAMERA\n\n               is set up to SHOOT THROUGH the press. The press lowers,\n\n               stamps and starts to move up. The printer, wearing the\n\n               typical box hat of his trade, reaches into the press for the\n\n               finished sheet and hands it to Sims.\n\n\n\n               INSERT     THE FINISHED SHEET.
