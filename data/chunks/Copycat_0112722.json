LECTURE HALL BERKELEY - DAY\n\n\n\n\tThe hall is full.  On the stage, DR. HELEN HUDSON is\n\n\tspeaking.  HELEN is a forensic psychologist.  Behind her is\n\n\ta projected diagram: PREDISPOSITION, DISSOCIATION, TRAUMA,\n\n\tFANTASY, VIOLENT FANTASY, FACILITATORS, MURDER, and\n\n\tTRAUMA-REINFORCEMENT which she can point to with a laser\n\n\tpointing device.  We see her from a considerable\n\n\tdistance... the back of the balcony.  Her voice is crisp and\n\n\tassured.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHELEN\n\n\t\tOur society creates these socially\n\n\t\tand psychically disenfranchised\n\n\t\tmen, and their revenge on society\n\n\t\tis terrible.  They are hard to\n\n\t\tcatch.  They are \"the nice guy next\n\n\t\tdoor,\" their employers -- if they\n\n\t\twork at all -- find them quiet and\n\n\t\tuncomplaining.  Early abuse and\n\n\t\trejection have taught them\n\n\t\tpassivity.  Only in their violent\n\n\t\tfantasies do they feel alive.  What\n\n\t\tthey seek in their frenzied\n\n\t\tassaults on their victims is relief\n\n\t\tfrom passivity.  For these men, ten\n\n\t\tminutes relief is worth far more\n\n\t\tthan the life of another human\n\n\t\tbeing.  Torture, the pain they\n\n\t\tinflict, the screams of the victim,\n\n\t\tare all part of the ritual that\n\n\t\tgives them a brief respite from\n\n\t\ttheir own psychic pain.  And then\n\n\t\tthe depression, the forgetting, the\n\n\t\tfeeling of sadness and despair\n\n\t\tbegins the cycle all over again.\n\n\t\tLike addicts seeking their drug,\n\n\t\tAlbert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono,\n\n\t\tBerkowitz, Dahmer, Bundy -- they\n\n\t\tseek out their next victim.",

Instantly\n\n\talert to HELEN'S alarm, he jumps up, comes within an inch of\n\n\texposing his presence to the audience.  A SECOND COP, in the\n\n\twings on the other side of the stage, also springs to\n\n\tattention.
