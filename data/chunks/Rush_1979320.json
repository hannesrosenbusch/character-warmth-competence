The plane load of JAMES's friends call out... \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\nC'mon, James!\"\n\n\n\n                         NIKI\n\n               You're right. I could learn from you.\n\n               In hospital the toughest part of my\n\n               treatment was the vacuum. Pumping the\n\n               shit out of my lungs. It was agony.\n\n               While doing it, I was watching\n\n               television...you winning all those\n\n               races...and I was cursing you.. \"That\n\n               bastard, Hunt\", I would shout, \"I hate\n\n               that guy.\" one day the doctor said,\n\n               \"Mr. Lauda, may I offer one piece of\n\n               advice? Stop thinking of it as a curse\n\n               to have been given an enemy in life.\n\n               It can be a blessing, too.\" I said,\n\n               \"Who are you, Confucius?\" He said, \"A\n\n               wise man gets more from his enemies\n\n               than a fool from his friends.\" And you\n\n               know, he's right. Look at us. We were\n\n               a pair of kids when we first met.\n\n               Hotheaded jerks in Formula 3. Headed\n\n               nowhere. Now we're both Champions of\n\n               the world. Not bad.\n\n\n\n                         JAMES\n\n               No, not bad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                        (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                       105\n\n204 CONTINUED: (3)                                               204\n\n\n\n\n\n                         NIKI\n\n               So don't let me down now. I need you\n\n               busting my balls. Get back to work.\n\n\n\n                         JAMES\n\n               I will, Niki. But I intend to enjoy\n\n               myself first. And so should you. You\n\n               think you can?\n\n\n\n   NIKI stares. A blank look..\n\n\n\n                         JAMES\n\n               See you on race day, Champ.\n\n\n\n                         NIKI\n\n               You will. Champ.\n\n\n\n   JAMES goes. NIKI watches him, pulled into his plane by his\n\n   laughing, cool FRIENDS. An unmistakable flicker of envy in his\n\n   eyes.\n\n\n\n   Then NIKI turns, alone, and resumes his safety checks.\n\n\n\n\n\n205 EXT.
