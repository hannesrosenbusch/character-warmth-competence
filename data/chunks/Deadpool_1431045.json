Rifles through\n\n    a tourist booklet and tears out a HAUNTED SEGWAY TOUR coupon.\n\n    The CABBIE, young, thin, brown, glances back and forth from\n\n    the rear view to the road to the rear view.\n\n\n\n                          DEADPOOL\n\n                Kinda lonesome back here.\n\n\n\n    CUT TO: DEADPOOL, WEDGING himself through the opening\n\n    between the back seat and front.
