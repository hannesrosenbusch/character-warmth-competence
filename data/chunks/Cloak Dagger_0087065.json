EUROPEAN VILLAGE ~ STREET - NIGHT\n\nOn a heavily shadowed street, two enemy Guards patrol a\ntactically important village block. Inside the most\nProminent building, a party is in Progress, music wafting\nout into the street. The two Guards meet at a corner near\nthe party's entrance, one loaning a cigarette to the other.\nThen they reverse their directions, walk apart, the Second\nGuard disappearing into the darkness of the night. Titles\nbegin.\n\nSuddenly, Jack Flack, everything a spy should be, swoops\ninto view, riding a square American-flag parachute down\nfrom a nearby rooftop. Red, white, and blue cut through\nthe darkness as he lands directly on top of the First Guard.\n\nThe parachute envelops them both. Two bodies thrash within\nthe silk. A moment later, Flack steps out, glances down the\nempty street. He wears a pair of tight pants and a beauti-\nfully cut brown leather jacket, molded perfectly to his\nbroad shoulders, tapering to a tight fit around his slender\nwaist. .\n\nHe pushes a hidden button on his jacket, and, with a whoosh,\nthe parachute repacks itself instantly back into the jacket,\nshowing not even a Lump.\n\nTITLES “CONTINUE. ©”\n\nThe Second Guard turns around, heads back toward the party\nbuilding.\n\nJack Flack strolls nonchalantly up to the Second Guard, who\nchallenges him.\n\nSECOND GUARD\n(in Russian)\nHalt!

Out of it steps a\nvillainous Iranian (with an uncanny resemblance to Khomeini),\narm-in-arm with the lovely Lady Gillingham, a voluptuous\nEnglishwoman. They are followed by a fat Soviet diplomat,\nwho carries a thin black briefcase chained to his right\n\narm.\n\nFrom the shadows, Flack makes his move: just as the black\nbag is passing him, he whips out a cord from his Jack Flack\nspy watch, with the same action used to start a chainsaw.\nIndeed, he is starting a chainsaw, a miniature one. Its\ntiny but effective blade running from his watch to his\nother hand. He instantly cuts through the chain, grabs the\nblack bag, and the flexible saw retracts back into his\nwatch.\n\nThe Iranian lunges at him with a scimitar. Flack deftly\nkicks the knife high into the night sky, then Kung Fu kicks\nthe Iranian! Lady Gillingham draws a Luger from a bra\nholsterette, fires at Flack, who cleverly doffs his\nofficial hat with the shiny bulletproof-steel inner liner.\nHe holds the hat shield between himself and the bullet,\ncausing it to ricochet off and plant itself right between\nLady Gillingham's beautiful eyes.\n\nThe Russian diplomat pulls one of those bowling ball-type\nbombs out of his pocket, its fuse already burning.
