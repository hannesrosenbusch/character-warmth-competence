HOOLEY FAMILY HOME - DAY 171\n\nThe back garden: small but ingeniously planted for maximum\nyield and colour. GEORGE straightens from a flowerbed as\nTERRI approaches.\n\nThey sit on a small bench.\n\nTERRI\nGarden's looking well.\n\nGEORGE\nThat’s what all the dirty work in\nwinter’s for.\n\nTERRI looks down at the mug. He’s almost forgotten he was\nholding it.\n\nTERRI\nHere.\n\nGEORGE\nDid your mother send you out with\nthat?\n\f172\n\n88.\n\nTERRI\nI thought I better offer before\nshe put the window in.

The\nreturning officer used to say if\nI was a horse they’d have shot me\nafter the sixth. But do you know\nwhat? I have friends and comrades\nliving all over his city. And do\nyou know what else? In every\nelection I increased my vote.\n\nTERRI’s gaze is locked on his father’s face. He looks as\nthough he might hug GEORGE, but GEORGE, unaware of this (or\nperhaps not so) chooses this moment to empty his tea leaves\non to the flowerbed.\n\nGEORGE (CONT'D)\nVictory doesn’t always look the\nway other people imagine it.\n\nINT. 102 GREAT VICTORIA STREET - EVENING 172\n\nRUDI members slouch against the wall nearest the door. DAVE\nstands only a few feet further in, arms folded tight.\n\nTERRI at moments in this scene is picking things up off the\nfloor, the counter: a physical counterpart to his verbal\nattempts to set things straight.\n\nTERRI\nAll right. A few apologies are in\norder.\n\nRUDI and DAVE look like they agree.\n\nTERRI (CONT'D)\nBrian, you want to start?\n\f89.\n\nExpectation turns to confusion on BRIAN’s face.\n\nTERRI (CONT'D)\n\nI’m only messing you.\n(beat)\n\nDave?\n\nDAVE opens his mouth to protest.

They look at one another.\n\nA beat. And they have returned to GOOD VIBRATIONS. TERRI -\nstill setting things straight - pulls the German magazine\ncover from the wall.\n\nDAVE\nHow many posters do you think\nyou'll need?\n\nEXT. BELFAST STREETS — DAY 173\n\nBRIAN is postering. GREG is postering; so too FANGS, GETTY,\nRONNIE, LANKY PUNK, and TERRI of course.\n\nHe stands before a wall with NF and SHANKILL SKINS scrawled\non it. He slaps a poster over the top. ‘Outcasts. Moondogs,\nRuefrex, Rudi, Big Self,’ it reads, ‘24th April 1980,\nUlster Hall.’\n\nEXT. BELFAST STREET - LATER 174\nRUTH is pushing a buggy. She passes a wall with Good\n\nVibrations posters.

A balding, bearded\nfigure in a blazer comes walking towards them.
