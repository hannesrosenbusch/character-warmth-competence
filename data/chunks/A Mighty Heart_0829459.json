  "1": "A MIGHTY HEART\n\nScreenplay by\nJohn Orloff\n\nBased on the book by\nMariane Pearl\n\nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT\n\nShooting Script - 25th August 2006\nPink Revisions - 27th September 2006\nBlue Revisions - 11th October 2006\n\nThis script is the confidential and proprietary property of\nParamount Vantage, and no portion of it may be performed,\ndistributed, reproduced, used, quoted, or published without prior\nwritten permission.\n\fNOTES ON OUR APPROACH.\n\nGiven the emotional power of the film comes from the fact\nthat it is a true story, we have tried to be as accurate as\npossible to the chronology of the real events.\n\nReal events don’t come in the neatly shaped packages of\nconventional drama. They are disorganised, sometimes\nrandom, often without explanation. We feel that not only\n\nis it more honest to remain true to these events, but it\nwill also add a sense of authenticity. We want the audience\nto trust that they are seeing an accurate account of what\nhappened. If they are convinced the film is authentic the\nemotional power of the film comes from the real, terrible\nsituation that Mariane and Danny found themselves in.\n\nOur main source of information is obviously Mariane’s book.\nHowever we have also talked to all the key characters\nbefore making the film. We have met with Mariane, Asra,\nRandall Bennett, Zahoor, Asif the Fixer, Jameel Yusuf,\nCaptain, Bussey, Dost and communicated with Steve LeVine.\nEach meeting adds extra details to the story.\n\nGiven this approach to the overall story telling it is\nobviously important that the detail within the scenes also\nseems natural, spontaneous and honest. The dialogue script\nis therefore a blueprint. A starting point for the actors,\ngiving a guide to the content of the scene. When we have\ncast the actors we would expect them to spend time with the\nreal characters, getting to know them, hearing how they\ntalk, getting details of their personal stories, seeing\ntheir point of view on the events of that time.\n\nWhen we film the scenes in Asra’s house - the heart of the\nstory - we will film on location in Pakistan or India.",

When we have\ncast the actors we would expect them to spend time with the\nreal characters, getting to know them, hearing how they\ntalk, getting details of their personal stories, seeing\ntheir point of view on the events of that time. When we film the scenes in Asra’s house - the heart of the\nstory - we will film on location in Pakistan or India. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n We\nwill shoot in chronological order, allowing the actors to\nbuild relationships with each other that mirror the\nrelationships the real characters had. The camera is hand\nheld, natural lighting is used where possible, allowing the\nactors the freedom to go where they want to go, to\nimprovise when they want. Often in the script a scene may\nbe boiled down to three or four lines of key dialogue. This\nmay well be what ends up in the finished film. But during\nthe filming we usually shoot the whole scene as it would\nnaturally happen. And we shoot the whole scene on each take\nto allow a natural rhythm to develop. It also means the\nscene can change and develop with each performance.\n\nWe therefore have a huge choice of material when it comes\nto the edit. However, the intention is that the editing\nshould be crisp and fast, creating the pace of a thriller.\nSo, although the script is currently 140 pages, we expect\nthe film to run somewhere between 100 and 110 minutes.\n\nThis is an approach we have used before on films such as\nTHE ROAD TO GUANTANAMO, TRISTRAM SHANDY, 24 HOUR PARTY\nPEOPLE and WONDERLAND.\n\f1A\n\n1B\n\nA MIGHTY HEART\nA BLACK SCREEN\n\nWe hear the sound of a baby crying.
