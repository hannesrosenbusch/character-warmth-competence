As the following lines appear on screen, the familiar\nDroeshout portrait of William Shakespeare fades very slowly\ninto view.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare was born on April 23rd 1564 in the\nEnglish market town of Stratford Upon Avon. He was the son of\na glove maker.\n\nOn November 27th 1582 he married Anne Hathaway. Will was 18,\nAnne was 26 and already pregnant. They had three children.\n\nIn the early 1590’s Will moved to London, where he was to\nbecome the most successful and famous writer of his age.\n\nHis family remained in Stratford.\nWill’s only son, Hamnet, died in 1596, aged eleven.\n\nThe portrait slowly dissolves from the canvas image into a\nliving, breathing version of the man himself, gazing the same\nenigmatic gaze at the viewer.\n\nCUT TO BLACK\n\nAs the following lines appear, we scan across a period map of\nthe densely crowded buildings of Elizabethan London.
