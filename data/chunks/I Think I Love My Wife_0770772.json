I was just\nmissing you and thought I’d come\nhome early.\n\nERICA\nAre you sure that’s it? For once\ncould you be honest and tell me\nwhat’s really wrong with you?\n\nMUSIC STARTS\n\nRichard and Erica start to talk/sing at each other, but not\n“sing sing” more of a talk-sing like the beginning of a Barry\nWhite or Rick James and Teena Marie record. Romantic music\nplays throughout the end of this scene.\n\nRICHARD\nYou know, baby, I.just wanna tell\nyou how sorry I am for being so\ncold. It’s not that I don’t like\nbeing married. It’s just that\nsometimes it feels like the walls\nare closing in on me.\n\nERICA\nI understand, baby. But it’s not\njust you. I gotta admit that I’ve\nbeen distant too. I haven’t always\nbeen nice. As a matter of fact,\nsometimes I’m as cold as ice.\n\nRICHARD\nSo cold. So cold. You’ve been\nvery cold, baby.\n\nERICA\nBut one thing I have to ask you,\nbaby... it’s time I know the score,\nbut the thing I have to ask you is\nhow come you don’t make love to me\nanymore?\n\nRICHARD \\\nIt’s been a long time.\n\nERICA\nA mighty, mighty long time.\n\f02.15.06 - ITILMW 104.\n\nRICHARD\nBaby, I still want you and I’ve\nwanted you for so long. But every\ntime I touch you, you act like I_\ndid something wrong.\n\nERICA\nNo, I don’t.\n\nRICHARD\nYes, you do.\nERICA\nNo, I don’t.\nRICHARD\nYes, it’s true... I don’t want to\nleave.\nERICA\n\nNeither do I.\n\nRICHARD\nI still want you.",

COOPER HOUSE - LATER\n\nWe see Richard come out of the master bedroom just: like in\nthe beginning of the movie. We see him put on his coat and\nwalk over to Erica and give her a big kiss goodbye. V.0O.\nstarts as Richard leaves the house. Al Green's, “Let Get\nMarried” is playing.\n\nRICHARD (V.0.)\nA lot of people have rules about\nwhat's cheating and what’s not.\nSome people say if you’re in\nanother country it’s not cheating.\nSome people say if you’re in\nanother room it’s not cheating. I\nused to think I was a good father\nand a bad husband, but now I that\nI’m older I realize that if you’re\ncheating on your wife, you’re\ncheating on your kids.\n\nINT. AIRPLANE - SAME TIME\n\nWe see Nikki sitting in first class gazing out the window\n, with her iPod on.\n\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nI’m really going to miss Nikki and\nthe bad thing is I can’t tell\nanybody about it. I gotta keep this\nwhole thing to myself.\n\ncur TO:\n\nINT. TRAIN\n\nRichard is sitting down, puts his iPod on and is looking out\nthe window as the train moves.\n\nRICHARD (V.O.)\nAny guy I’d tell would think I was\nerazy for not having sex with her.\nAnd any woman I tell would think I\nwas a dog for letting it get that\nfar.\n\n \n\f02.15.06 - ITILMW 106.\n\nINT.
