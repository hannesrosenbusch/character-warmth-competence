He feigns embarrassment.\n\nINT. 3RD FLOOR - DAY\n\nELEVATOR DOORS OPEN. The UPS Man throws the package out onto the floor and starts \n\nkicking it down the hall like a soccer player. With one last big kick the parcel lands in front of \n\nAPARTMENT 3B. He picks it up and knocks on the door.\n\nWe hear a small dog barking.\n\nGRUFF MAN (O.S.)\n\n Shut the hell up, you stupid mutt!\n\nAn angry, burly man pokes his nose hairs out the chained door.\n\nGRUFF MAN\n\n What do you want?\n\nUPS MAN\n\n UPS, sir.

Einhorn's head flies back. The hair is \n\nreal. Ace keeps tugging it.\n\nThe SWAT team ready themselves.\n\nACE (CONT'D)\n\n Boy, that's really on there! But\n\ntell me this: Would a real woman\n\nbe missing these?!\n\nAce rips open Einhorn's blouse, and reveals two beautiful feminine breasts.\n\nThe sharp shooters are tensing. Ace is laughing nervously now.\n\nACE\n\n Ha, ha, ha! That kind of surgery\n\ncan be done over the weekend! But\n\nI doubt if she could find the time\n\nduring her busy schedule to get\n\nrid of Mr. Knish!!\n\nAce rips off Einhorn's skirt. Einhorn now stands there fully nude. She appears to be the perfect \n\nfigure of a woman.\n\nACE\n\n Oooh boy.\n\nAce looks at Melissa and Emilio and shrugs his shoulders. Then, just when it seems all is lost, Dan \n\nMarino who is back behind Einhorn, motions for Ace to come over.\n\nMARINO\n\n Psst Ace. Come here.\n\nACE\n\n(to everyone)\n\n Could you excuse me just a second.\n\nAce goes to Dan. Melissa still holds Emilio hostage.\n\nEINHORN\n\n Shoot him. Shoot him, now!!\n\nMELISSA\n\n(to cops)\n\n Don't anybody make a move!\n\nMarino whispers something in his ear. Ace looks confident again. He once more addresses the \n\ncrowd.\n\nACE\n\n Ladies and gentlemen, my esteemed\n\ncolleague Mr. Marino, has just\n\nbrought some new evidence to my\n\nattention. Now, history has\n\ncertainly shown that even the most\n\nintuitive criminal minds can be\n\nwrong, from time to time.

After \n\na few seconds Finkle fights his way to the surface and thrashes around, helplessly.\n\nFINKLE\n\n(gasping for air)\n\n Help I can't swim!!!\n\nFinkle goes under again.

Finkle lies there exhausted.\n\nAce reaches down into frame, removing the '82 AFC Championship ring from Finkle's finger. We \n\nsee that it's the ring with the missing stone.
