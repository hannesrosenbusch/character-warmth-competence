BUICK LESABRE, MOVING — PHILADELPHIA — NIGHT (1995)\nA Phillies baseball game broadcast is heard on the radio:\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER\n...Here’s the 2-1 to Dykstra. Low and\naway, ball 3. Dykstra’s one for two on\nthe night. He singled in the first and\ngrounded into a fielder’s choice...\n\nJIMMY CONLON, early 30s, sits behind the wheel, a cigarette\ndangling from his lips as he listens to the play-by-play. His\nruddy Irish face is roughened and broken, like that a\nheavyweight boxer who never knew when to throw in the towel.\n\nUp ahead, red lights glow as a CADILLAC DEVILLE brakes and\nsteers toward the curb. Jimmy follows, parking at a distance.\n\nTwo men step out of the Deville dressed in suits; SHAWN\nMAGUIRE, 30s, and his consigliere, PAT MULLEN, 30s.\n\nShawn approaches. Jimmy rolls the window down and Shawn leans\nin. He’s handsome, tough, savagely loyal. The type of leader\nyou'd follow anywhere. And Jimmy does.\n\nSHAWN\nWe're gonna get the parents now. You\nall set, ace?\n\nJimmy nods. Shawn smiles as sharp as a new penny, playfully\nslaps Jimmy’s cheek, then goes.\n\nJimmy watches as Shawn and Pat approach a duplex and knock on\nthe front door. An ELDERLY COUPLE answers. Shawn shakes the\nman’s hand and gentlemanly helps the woman down the steps.\nThe four enter the Cadillac and it cruises off.\n\nJimmy goes to work now. Shuts off the radio. Stubs out his\ncigarette. Slides on leather gloves. Opens the glove\ncompartment and removes a STAINLESS STEEL SW1911 .45 ACP\nPISTOL. Tucks it into his black leather coat and —\n\nEXT. STREET — CONTINUOUS\n\nJimmy strides toward the home we saw the Elderly Couple exit.",

He can hear a SHOWER RUNNING and\nstarts down the hall in that direction and...\n\n...into a BEDROOM. A fusty, antiquated decor. Paintings of\nJesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, a crucifix on the wall. The\nPhillies game plays on the television. The sound of the\nshower gets LOUDER and LOUDER AND LOUDER as he moves into...\n\f...the BATHROOM. Thick with steam. Impossible to see. The\nwater so fucking loud now, like a WATERFALL CRASHING and —\n\nJimmy RIPS the shower curtain back.

Jimmy FIRES! Right between the eyes. Billy COLLAPSES to\nthe floor of the tub like he doesn’t have bones. But\nstrangely he doesn’t die. Instead, he feels at the hole\nbetween his eyes and the river of blood racing down his face\nand he begins to LAUGH.\n\nJimmy raises the pistol again — BLAM! BLAM! — two bullets RIP\nHOLES in Billy’s chest. He FLOPS AROUND like a fish out of\nwater, GASPING horribly for air...but it’s all a big joke.\n\nJimmy FIRES the pistol, over and over, but it only serves to\nmake Billy LAUGH LOUDER, MORE MANIACALLY, as if he’s being\ntickled by the bullets and —\n\nINT.
