I grew up in Pakistan. And people\n\n              are always asking me, what was that like?\n\n              Really not that different from here. I\n\n              mean we played cricket, which is just a\n\n              spicier version of baseball. And we\n\n              prayed a lot. Well not a lot, just five\n\n              times a day. And we marry someone our\n\n              parents find for us. Arranged marriage,\n\n              you know. For me, it was probably that we\n\n              got episodes of the A-Team a little bit\n\n              later. And by a little bit later, I mean\n\n              we just got episode two. But other than\n\n              that, it was exactly the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    A CREDIT SEQUENCE PLAYS.\n\n\n\n    Kumail drives an Uber around Chicago with VARIOUS\n\n    PASSENGERS in the backseat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    INT.
