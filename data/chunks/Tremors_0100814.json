Edgar turns, concerned.  Now we hear an\n\n               odd sound.  Distant thunder?  The wind?

Now Edgar is hit by a ghastly stench.  He staggers\n\n               back, and covers his nose with a handkerchief.

Smart and good looking, Val\n\n               has nevertheless managed to underachieve brilliantly.  He\n\n               coasts through life, following the path of least resistance\n\n               -- which has brought him to this dubious rustic existence on\n\n               the edge of civilization.  But lately he's beginning to\n\n               wonder why he hasn't accomplished more in his 25 years.\n\n\n\n               As a few sleepy cows gaze at him, sleepy Val shuffles over to\n\n               his battered old pickup truck.  A hand-painted sign on the\n\n               door reads: \"V & E -- All Type's of Job's.\"  Indeed, the\n\n               pick-up bed is jumbled with tools and supplies for every\n\n               conceivable odd job -- and the noisily snoring form of his\n\n               partner huddled in a dirty sleeping bag.  Val raps on the\n\n               side of the truck.\n\n\n\n                                          VAL\n\n                                   (softly)\n\n                            Good morning, Mr. Bassett, this is\n\n                            your wake-up call.

Val stares at the cows\n\n               chewing their cud -- and perks up as he gets an idea.  He\n\n               gently steps onto the truck's running board, then suddenly\n\n               starts jumping up and down as hard as he can, rocking the\n\n               truck violently.\n\n\n\n                                          VAL (cont'd)\n\n                            STAMPEDE!

While Val laughs uproar-\n\n               iously, EARL BASSET (43) claws his way out of the bag, looks\n\n               around wildly, and finds himself staring at three motionless\n\n               cows.\n\n\n\n                                          EARL\n\n                            You dumb shit.\n\n\n\n               Earl is a good-ol' boy who has lived his life just like Val,\n\n               drifting from job to job.

Earl whirls the\n\n               bomb on the end of its rope like a lasso, and lets it fly out\n\n               as far as he can.  Then he starts pulling it back in along\n\n               the ground like a fishing lure.
