A\n\n          light comes on in a FARMHOUSE window. The door opens, a small\n\n          dog and a young girl emerge.\n\n\n\n                         GIRL\n\n          Go on now Paul, don't be long.\n\n\n\n          The dog trots out across the property. It stops to scratch.\n\n          The sounds of night cease. The dog stops scratching, sniffing\n\n          the air, cocking its head, sensing something. We hear a low\n\n          humming sounds. The dog looks up. We see a soft orange glow\n\n          reflected in its eyes. The dog whimpers\n\n          Back at the farmhouse, a deep, dull thud shakes the ground,\n\n          bringing the small girl back out onto the veranda. An orange\n\n          glow pulsates somewhere out in the darkness.\n\n\n\n                         GIRL\n\n          Paul...

GRAHAM\n\n          is thin but his clothes seem too small. He has long greasy\n\n          hair, buck teeth and thick glasses. CLIVE is bigger and wears\n\n          a long black leather coat, Red Dwarf T-shirt and boots.

The cross-walk beeps.\n\n          As the music kicks in, GRAHAM and CLIVE set off across the\n\n          road towards the San Diego Convention Centre.

They\n\n          said I was concussed,\n\n          hallucinating, but I knew you were\n\n          real. I pulled you from that\n\n          spaceship myself.
