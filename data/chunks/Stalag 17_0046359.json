Searchlights sweep over the barracks, \n               the muddy ground with the snow patches, and the pine forest \n               beyond the barbed-wire.

I.s watching. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\n               Sefton is walking along. Behind him, Duke has come out of \n               the barrack and is following him. Sefton becomes aware of \n               it. Nonchalantly, he walks into a wash latrine.\n\n               INT. WASH LATRINE\n\n               Sefton comes in. There is another P.O.W. there, a colored \n               guy, just finishing washing his hands. Sefton quickly climbs \n               up a couple of rungs of the ladder leading to the water tank \n               and stops there. The colored P.O.W. doesn't notice it.\n\n               EXT. WASH LATRINE\n\n               Duke stands some distance away, watching the only pair of \n               legs visible under the raised partition. The legs move now \n               down the length of the latrine and out the other end. The \n               colored P.O.W. emerges and walks off with his back toward \n               Duke. Duke follows him.\n\n               INT. WASH LATRINE\n\n               Sefton jumps off the ladder and exits the way he came in.\n\n                                     COOKIE'S VOICE\n                         It was a funny thing about Sefton \n                         and me. I guess I knew him as well \n                         as anybody else in the camp because \n                         I had worked for him for two years. \n                         But there were lots of things I didn't \n                         know about him. Take for instance, \n                         where he would disappear to once in \n                         a while. Of course, I had a hunch, \n                         but it seemed so crazy I couldn't \n                         quite believe it -- Just as I would \n                         never have believed that Sefton was \n                         the guy that would give away \n                         Lieutenant Dunbar for blowing up \n                         that ammunition train.\n\n               EXT. COMPOUND\n\n               Duke is still following the wrong guy. Now the P.O.W. stops \n               to talk to a pal. Duke realizes his mistake. He dashes back \n               into the wash latrine and comes out again. He stands there \n               frustrated. With the football players rushing about, passes \n               being thrown and G.I.s milling around, he has lost Sefton.\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n               INT.

Out of the Buick steps the Geneva Man: a \n               friendly type, about fifty-five, dressed in civilian clothes \n               and carrying a brief case. He tips his Homburg to the P.O.W.s, \n               but they are more interested in the truck. While a couple of \n               German lieutenants exchange credentials with the Geneva Man, \n               the Red Cross drivers roll back the tarpaulin of the truck, \n               and the P.O.W.s (including all the men from Barrack 4, except \n               Sefton) crowd around the goodies.\n\n                                     COOKIE'S VOICE\n                         Now, there's a lot of folks around \n                         these days that don't believe in \n                         Santa Claus. I always did and I always \n                         will. For a while there, I thought \n                         the German Luftwaffe had shot him \n                         down, reindeer, sleigh and all. But, \n                         no sir! Come the day before Christmas, \n                         he showed up with some presents for \n                         us, the Geneva Man did. He had started \n                         out with seven truckloads. He was \n                         lucky to get one of them through -- \n                         with all the bombing and booby traps \n                         and pilfering. Still, they were \n                         presents and made you feel good: \n                         coffee, a little sugar and some candy \n                         and toothbrushes and about a thousand \n                         rolls of that sanitary paper. Brother, \n                         they sure kept sending us reams of \n                         that stuff. I'll bet you if they had \n                         dropped all that paper on Berlin the \n                         first day, the war would have been \n                         over right then and there.\n\n               INT.
