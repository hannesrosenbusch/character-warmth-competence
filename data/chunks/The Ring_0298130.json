There are\nSNACKS\n\nall over the room, and it’s obvious there hasn’t been much studying\ngoing\n\non. Masami is currently in mid-story, speaking excitedly.\n\nMASAMI\nThey say that some elementary school\nkid spent the night with his parents\nat a bed and breakfast in Izu. The kid\nwanted to go out and play with everybody\nright, but he didn’t want to miss the\nprogram he always used to watch back in\nTokyo, so he records it on the VCR in\ntheir room. But of course the stations\nin Izu are different from the ones in\nTokyo. In Izu, it was just an empty\nchannel, so he should’ve recorded\nnothing but static. But when the kid\ngets back to his house and watches the\ntape, all of a sudden this woman comes\n\fon the screen and says--\n\nMasami points so suddenly and dramatically at her friend that Tomoko\nactually jumps in her seat.\n\nMASAMI (cont’d)\n“One week from now, you will die.”\n\nShort silence as Masami pauses, relishing the moment.\n\nMASAMI (cont’d)\nOf course the kid’s completely\nfreaked, and he stops the video.\nJust then the phone rings, and when he\npicks it up a voice says--\n\nHer voice drops voice almost to a whisper.",

She regards the fearsome thing before her with an\nalmost tender look. Asakawa reaches out, lightly strokes that long\nhair.\n\nASAKAWA\nIt’s you...\n\nShe strokes the hair again, and abruptly it peels right off the head\nwith a loud SQUELCH. Revealed is not a face at all but a SKULL. Its\n\fsockets are at first menacingly empty, but then begin to ooze the\ngreen SLUDGE it has pulled up from the bottom of the well. Like a\nmother comforting a frightened child, Asakawa pulls the skeletal\nremains to her breast, strokes the bony head comfortingly. Her eyes\nbegin to glaze.\n\nCUT to Ryuji racing up to the rim of the well, leaning down\nintently.\n\nRYUJI\nHey! Asakawa! It’s already 10\nminutes past seven! We did it!\n\nDown in the well, Asakawa continues staring blankly ahead. Her body\nsuddenly falls forward, limp.\n\nEXT. OUTSIDE COTTAGE B4 — NIGHT\n\nThree POLICE CARS are parked outside the rental cottages, crimson\nheadlights flashing. A few COPS walk by, two of them carrying\nsomething off in white PLASTIC BAGS. CUT to Ryuji and Asakawa\nsitting on the curb. Asakawa is staring off at something, a BLANKET\ndraped over her shoulder.\n\nASAKAWA\nWhy would Ikuma have killed her?\nHis own daughter...\n\nRYUJI\nMaybe she wasn’t his daughter at all.\n\nASAKAWA\nWhat?\nRYUJI\nMaybe her father... wasn’t even human.\n\nThe two exchange glances. Ryuji’s gaze falls to Asakawa’s WRIST,\nwhich he suddenly takes and holds close to his face. The ugly\nbruise where Sadako had grabbed her has disappeared.\n\nRYUJI\nIt’s gone...\n\nHe shakes his head, clearing his analytical mind of their ordeal.\nRYUJI\nEnough, already. It’s over. C’mon.\n\nI’1l take you home.\n\nRyuji stands, pulls Asakawa to her feet.\n\fEXT.",

EXT. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n OUTSIDE ASKAWA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nRyuji’s white CAR pulls up into the parking lot. He and Asakawa\nget out, regard each other from opposite sides of the car. There is\na long moment where neither of them says anything.\n\nRYUJI\nGet some rest.\n\nHe flashes her the slightest of grins.\n\nRYUJI (cont’d)\nI still have a thesis to finish.\n\nCUT to a shot of Ryuji and Asakawa, the car creating an almost\nmetaphoric distance between them.\n\nASAKAWA\n.».thank you.\n\nRyuji nods silently by way of reply. He gets into his car and\ndrives off. Asakawa watches him go, and then walks towards the\nentrance of her apartment.\n\nINT. ASAKAWA’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING\n\nAsakawa walks into her room, sits on the edge of her bed. It is\nnow morning, and she sits dazedly watching the sun come up.\n\nINT. RYUJI’S APARTMENT - MORNING\n\nRyuji sits busily scribbling into a NOTEBOOK. He stops writing a\nmoment to regard his notes while taking a sip of COFFEE. He\nglances over at his BLACKBOARD for confirmation when a small scowl\ncrosses his brow. It’s gone a moment later as he chuckles wryly\nto himself.\n\nRYUJI\nThat girl...\n\nRyuji stands, walks over to the blackboard. He fixes Mai’s little\nprank with a single chalk stroke.\n\nEXT. ASAKAWA’S APARTMENT - VERANDA - MORNING\n\nAsakawa emerges, taking in the dawn. At first her face is calm and\ntranquil... but her features change as the sun almost noticeably\ndarkens and a WIND begins to kick up her hair. She now looks very\n\nanxious.\n\nCaption-- “September 21st. Tuesday.”\n\fNOTE: This next scene is entirely visual.

His hand suddenly\nceases, eyes dancing worriedly as he hears a faint... \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\nNo.\n\nBreath rattling fearfully in his throat, Ryuji spins around to face\nthe TELEVISION SET. He gets out of his seat for a better look,\nfalling to his knees on the tatami.\n\nThe image that fills the screen is the last scene from the\nvideotape;\nthe shot of the well.\n\nThe SOUND from before comes louder now, more insistent, a metallic\n\nscreeching that both repulses and beckons him closer. Ryuji crawls\non\n\nall fours towards the SCREEN, stares at its unchanging image with\n\nterrible foreboding.\n\nThere is a flash of MOTION as something shoots out of the well. A\n\nhand. First one, and then another, as Sadako, still in her grimy\nwhite\n\ndress, face hidden beneath long, oily strands of hair, begins slowly\n\npulling herself out. The television screen jumps unsteadily, fills\n\nwith static as if barely able to contain her image.\n\nCUT back and forth between Ryuji, who is beginning to visibly panic,\nand the television, which shows Sadako lurching ever closer.\n\nRYUJI\n(almost frantic)\nWhy?!\n\nThe TELEPHONE rings, and Ryuji spins round towards it, breath\ncatching\n\nin his throat. He looks at the phone, over his shoulder at the\n\ntelevision, back to the phone.\n\nRYUJI\nThat’s it! Asakawa...\n\nRyuji scrambles wildly towards the phone. He takes the receiver but\nis unable to do more than clutch it fearfully as his gaze is drawn\n\finexorably back to the television. Sadako’s shrouded face has\nfilled\n\nthe entire screen... and then, television popping and crackling, she\njerks forward and emerges from the television onto the floor of\nRyuji’s apartment. Ryuji backs away, screaming in terror.\nRYUJI\nAaargh!\n\nSadako lies prone, collapsed, hair splayed out like a drowned\ncorpse.\n\nOnly her FINGERS are active, crawling, feeling.

OUTSIDE RYUJI’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY\n\nAsakawa comes running down a side street, turning the corner and\n\fmaking for the entrance to Ryuji’s apartment building. There is a\nsingle GUARD posted at the entrance. He reaches out, catches Asakawa\nlightly by the arm.\n\nGUARD\nAre you a resident here, ma’am?\n\nASAKAWA\nI’m Takayama Ryuji’s wife!\n\nThe guard drops his hand, and Asakawa makes for the entrance.\n\nGUARD\nI’m sorry ma’am, but they’ve already\ntaken the body away.\n\nAsakawa’s spins around, eyes wide.

She thinks\nfrantically to herself.\n\fASAKAWA (VO)\nRyuji... why? Does this mean that\nYoichi will die, too? Is the curse\nnot broken yet?\n\nHer gaze falls to the television set. She dives forward, presses\nthe eject button on the VCR. Sure enough, the TAPE is still in\nthe deck. She takes the tape and leaves.\n\nINT. ASAKAWA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nAsakawa walks slowly, dreamily forward. She drops the videotape\nloudly onto the coffee table and slouches into a CHAIR. Her eyes\nfall to the framed photographs of Yoichi on one of the shelves.\nThis snaps Asakawa out of her daze and she begins whispering\nintently to herself, thinking.\n\nASAKAWA\nI was the only one to break\nSadako’s curse. Ryuji... why...?\n\nSomething I did that you didn’t...\nSomething I did that you didn’t...\n\nAsakawa gives up, lowers her face into her hands. When she looks\nup again, she happens to glance at the television screen-- and\nits GLARE reveals that there is someone ELSE in the room with her.\nIt is the figure from the videotape, the silent accuser with the\ncloth draped over its face. With a start, Asakawa realizes that\nthe figure is wearing Ryuji’s clothes.\n\nASAKAWA\nRyuji?!\n\nShe spins around, but the room is empty. Asakawa’s mind races.\nThe figure had been pointing towards her BAG.
