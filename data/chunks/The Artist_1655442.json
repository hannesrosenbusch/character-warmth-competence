The images are in\nblack and white, in format 1.33.\n\nTITLES 1\n\nThe letters of the titles come up on a title card typical of\nthe 1920s. Elegant motifs around the edge of the frame, and,\nin the background, there are geometrical shapes reminiscent\nof the light beams of a film premiére. Behind is a stylized\ntown. The titles end in a fade to black. On black, the date\nappears on the screen: 1927\n\nINT. LABORATORY - DAY 2\n\nIn a \"futuristic\" 1920s laboratory, a man in tail coat and\nbow tie is being tortured. Ultrasound is being piped into his\nears. It's incredibly painful! He's screaming.\n\nTitle card:\nI‘m not telling! I won’t talk!!!\n\nHis torturers, cold men of science in white coats, gradually\nincrease the volume. The pain seems unbearable, the volume\nreaches level 10 (maximum), the man passes out!\n\nINT. CELLS & CORRIDORS - DAY 3\n\nGuards wearing long leather overcoats throw the man into a\ncell!\n\nAs the man is lying there on the ground, a dog wiggles\nthrough the bars at the window. The dog, a Jack Russell,\njumps on top of the man - visibly his master ~ and begins to\nlick his face. The man opens one eye! When he sees his dog,\nhe can't help cracking a smile...\n\nThe man, now on his feet, looks in pain. Despite the pain, he\nmotions to his dog who begins to bark in lively fashion.\n\nOutside the cell, the guard looks curious about the noise.",

His ears are still\ncausing him pain, but he opens a drawer and takes out his\nbelongings: a top hat which he snaps open, and a mask, which\nhe puts over his head to conceal his eyes.\n\nWe catch up with the masked man walking down corridors. He\nsuddenly stops, copied by his dog who follows him like his\nshadow. The man, on his guard, has spotted another guard\nwhere two corridors meet.\n\nWith a look, he orders his dog to move forwards into the\nguard's line of sight. The guard looks over at the animal.\nUsing his fingers, the hero pretends to shoot his dog. The\ndog collapses, plays dead. The guard, increasingly curious,\ngets to his feet. He slowly approaches the motionless dog.\nWhen he comes close he is attacked from the side by the hero,\nwho quickly puts him out of action with a mere punch!\n\nThe masked man then rushes to another cell, and releases a\nyoung female prisoner.

He was standing close to his dog, motioning\nto it not to make a noise. The dog's name is Jack.\n\nIn the same area, we've also seen the lead actress. Her name\nis Constance Gray. She too looks tense and is latched onto\nthe arm of a pleasant-looking man who is chewing anxiously on\na cigar. The man looks rich, but a little weak. He's surely\nthe producer.\n\nINT.

George Valentin comes onto the stage\nand acknowledges the audience, they are cheering for him. He\nis so happy he dances a few tap steps to express his joy then\nhe acknowledges the orchestra before finally motioning to\nsomeone in the wings to join him. Jack the dog trots over in\nresponse. The crowd laughs and cheers, George waves to the\ndog, Jack waves back then waves at the audience, the people\nare loving it!\n\nIn the wings, Constance is fuming with rage, but on stage,\nGeorge is pretending with his fingers to pull at the dog, who\nfakes death.

She isn't feeling comfortable. George motions firing a\ngun with his fingers, but she does not fall down, merely\ncasts him a \"very funny\" glance. George looks at his fingers,\nnot understanding why they don't work anymore then mimes\nthrowing them away behind him, as though they've become\nuseless. Constance stalks back off into the wings in\nannoyance, but the audience is ecstatic. Once in the wings,\nthe actress sticks up her middle finger at George, and\nexaggeratedly mouths so he can read her lips: \"Put this up\nyour ass.\" George, grinning broadly, responds by clapping his\nhands in applause, then leaves the stage, executing a few\nmore dance steps as he does so. The audience is delighted.\n\nAs he comes off stage, George gets soundly told off by\nConstance, but, still grinning, he motions towards the\naudience who are still asking for more. The producer,\nalthough delighted by the successful reception, makes a weak\nattempt to calm the actress down. As for George, he returns\nto the stage, the audience roars. He pretends to want to\nleave the stage, and mimes bumping into an invisible wall\njust as he's leaving the stage. George holds his nose, the\naudience goes wild, Constance gets even madder, and while\nGeorge carries on clowning about, the producer too breaks\ninto a beaming smile. He's probably realized that George has\nthe audience on his side.. Constance, furious, storms off. She\nis followed by the producer who is trying to placate her,\nalthough it looks like he's got his work cut out for him.\n\nEXT.

George is delighted at the sight, by the whole scene\nand, realizing this, the young woman steals a kiss. Flash.

PEPPY'S HOUSE ~ DAY 110\n\nFrom the window, we see the chauffeur get into the car and\ndrive off. We recognize the car as being the one that belonged\nto George.\n\n(109) At the window, George watches him leave. Then he seems\nto have an idea or, more exactly, an intuition.\n\nINT. PEPPY’S HOUSE - STOREROOM - DAY 111\n\nGeorge goes into the room that's full of sheets. He goes\nstraight over to the object with the bizarre shape and lifts up\nthe sheet. Underneath he finds his former objet d'art, the\nthree monkeys \"hear no evil\", \"speak no evil\" and \"see no\nevil\". He thinks for a moment, then pulls of another sheet to\nreveal a piece of furniture. Once again it's a piece that used\nto belong to him and we recognize it from having seen it at the\nauction room.\n\nAfter taking off several other sheets, George realizes that\nshe bought everything he had put up for sale: furniture,\npaintings, objets d'art, souvenirs, etc. He rips off sheets\none after the other and the objects appear, even down to his\nsuits and tuxedos. He continues and discovers the painting\ndepicting him in a tux, waving and smiling. George looks\nstunned at the sight of himself looking so full of life. He's\ninterrupted by the same ray of light which surges into the room\nonce more. This time, at the door, are the butler and the maid.\n\nGeorge walks towards them when he sees them. The closer he gets\nto them, however, the more his expression tightens. We realize\nthat the butler is none other than the distinguished-looking\nman who purchased everything at the auction, and that the maid\nis the woman who was bidding against him to raise the sale\nprices. George is looking at them as he leaves the room. He has\nrecognized them, but doesn't say anything to them. He walks\noff, still shocked by what he's just realized.",

BEGGAR STREET - DAY 114\n\nGeorge is in the street wearing his burnt suit and damaged\n\nshoes. He is shirtless. With Jack by his side, he walks along\n\nthe sidewalk. There are a few other people walking along. About |\ntwenty yards ahead of him a man is begging. He holds out his\nhand to passers-by. George approaches and, when there are no\nother passers-by between him and George, the beggar glances at\nhim and lowers his hand. He doesn't raige it as George\napproaches. George stops in front of him and looks at him, but\nthe beggar motions to him to scram. George continues on his\nway. For that moment at least, he has become one of them.\n\nHe buttons up the collar of his suit in an attempt to hide the\nfact that he doesn't have a shirt then, heads off and loses\nhimself in the crowd. Some distance later, he stops to check\nhis reflection in a shop window. The image he sees is that of a\nbum. It's even more striking because the in the window there is\na young male mannequin wearing a tux, top hat and white scarf.\nThe image of the mannequin and that of George are superimposed.\n\nA cop comes up to George and begins talking to him ina\nfriendly manner. He speaks but we don't know what about. There\nis not Title card. George visibly has no idea what the cop is\ntalking about. The cop seems to be talking about nothing\nimportant, just chatting... He talks and talks... George\ndoesn't understand what he's saying, and doesn't understand\nwhy he's talking to him. He's lost.\n\nTitle card: What did you say?\n\nThe cop smiles, carries on talking, then stops. He thinks\nhe's talking to a madman.

PEPPY’S HOUSE - DAY 115\n\nPeppy gets home in the evening, arms laden with flowers. She's\nhappy-\n\nShe quickly goes up the stairs and into George's bedroom. He's\nnot there. She looks for him but can't find him. The maid says\nthat he has left. She drops the flowers.\n\nINT. GEORGE’S BURNT HOUSE - DAY 116\nGeorge goes into his house that has been disfigured by the\n\nfire. The flames have changed everything and the atmosphere,\nhere again, seems ghostly and sad.\n\f117\n\n119\n\n120\n\n39.\n\nGeorge sits down in an armchair in the darkness. Jack sits down\nfacing him. He wags his tail and it thumps on the ground.\n\nINT. PEPPY’S HOUSE - RE! ~ DAY 117\n\nIn the room with all the sheets, Peppy ie with the maid. The\nmaid seems to be telling her what happened with George, how he\nremoved all the sheets, etc. Peppy listens with an inscrutable\nexpression on her face. Then, suddenly overcome by a terrible\nthought, she rushes outside.\n\nEXT. PEPPY’S HOUSE - DAY 118\n\nShe runs out of the house and over to the car, but the\nchauffeur isn't there. She honks the horn to call him but\nthere's no response. She honks the horn again, then, not\nwanting to wait any longer, and seeing the keys on the\ndashboard, she gets behind the wheel, starts the engine and\npulls off in a series of kangaroo hops. It's obvious that she\ndoesn't know how to drive all that well, but still goes at full\nspeed - more or less successfully. Just as she passes through\nthe gate, the chauffeur turns up. Too late. He sees her drive\naway.\n\nEXT. PI ‘8 DRIVING) - ¥ 119\n\nPeppy is driving as fast as she can through town, but she's\npretty reckless and almost causes an accident.\n\nINT.

GEORGE’S BURNT HOUSE - DAY 121\n\nOutside, we see Peppy's car has rammed into the gate and is\nstill shuddering. Peppy didn't brake in time, but she doesn't\ncare. She jumps out the car and runs into the house.\n\nINT. GEORGE’ ~ DAY 122\n\nShe rushes into the living room and stops for a moment to look\nat George.
