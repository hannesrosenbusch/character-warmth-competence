There is a moment's hesitation, and then the\nsimple words in white lettering:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  THE GODFATHER\n\nWhile this remains, we hear: \"I believe in America.\"\nSuddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a\nman of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great\nemotion.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBONASERA\n\t\t\tAmerica has made my fortune.\n\nAs he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBONASERA\n\t\t\tI raised my daughter in the American\n\t\t\tfashion; I gave her freedom, but\n\t\t\ttaught her never to dishonor her\n\t\t\tfamily.  She found a boy friend,\n\t\t\tnot an Italian.  She went to the\n\t\t\tmovies with him, stayed out late.\n\t\t\tTwo months ago he took her for a\n\t\t\tdrive, with another boy friend.\n\t\t\tThey made her drink whiskey and\n\t\t\tthen they tried to take advantage\n\t\t\tof her.  She resisted; she kept her\n\t\t\thonor.  So they beat her like an\n\t\t\tanimal.  When I went to the hospital\n\t\t\ther nose was broken, her jaw was\n\t\t\tshattered and held together by\n\t\t\twire, and she could not even weep\n\t\t\tbecause of the pain.\n\nHe can barely speak; he is weeping now.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBONASERA\n\t\t\tI went to the Police like a good\n\t\t\tAmerican.  These two boys were\n\t\t\tarrested and brought to trial.  The\n\t\t\tjudge sentenced them to three years\n\t\t\tin prison, and suspended the\n\t\t\tsentence.

He is greeted at the head of\nthe stairs by SONNY, who takes his hand and shakes it,\nintroducing himself.  For a moment, there is a complex of\nhandshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful\nintroductions.  Finally, SOLLOZZO is taken into the DON's\nglass paneled office; the two principals are introduced.\nThey are very respectful of one another.  Folding chairs are\nbrought in by FREDDIE, and soon they are all sitting around\nin a circle; the DON, SOLLOZZO, SONNY, HAGEN, FREDDIE,\nCLEMENZA and TESSIO.  The DON is the slightest bit foolish\nwith all his compatriots, whereas SOLLOZZO has brought no\none.
