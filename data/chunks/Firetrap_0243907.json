Quicho’s ten\nmiles from Detroit, but it might as well be a hundred.\n\nQuicho's got it all: freezing weather, a closed down steel\nmill, and a diner that advertises a burnt cup of Maxwell\nHouse as \"The World's Greatest Coffee.\" If Dr. Kevorkian\ntook towns as patients, Quicho would be at the top of h\nlist.\n\n \n\nA police truck stops in front of the bank. Chief MARTY WALSH\nhops out of the truck and walks over to the bank. Checks to\nmake sure that the doors are locked.\n\nMarty's in his mid 30's. He'd be a good-looking guy if he\nfollowed through on his perennial New Year resolutions to\nswitch to light beer and eat less red meat.\n\nHe walks across the street to the Post Office. Checks the\ndoors. Locked up tight.\n\nMarty climbs back into his truck. Si\nEXT. QUICHO COUNTRY STORE - NIGHT\n\nMarty walks up to the front door. The store's closed. He\npulls out a large key-ring, shuffles through the keys.\nFinds the one he wants. Opens up the store. Walks in.\n\nINT. QUICHO COUNTRY STORE - CONTINUOUS\n\nMarty walks through the dark store. He grabs a six-pack of\nBud out of a cooler. Walks over to the cash register. Does\na double-take at the porn magazines. Picks up a \"Playboy.\"\nFlips through the pages for a quick beat.\n\nMARTY\n(off centerfold)\nNineteen eighty-one? Jesus, I'm\ngetting old.\n\nMarty tosses it back on the rack. Then he throws a $5 bill\nand a note that reads, \"6er of Bud -- Marty\" on the cash\nregister.\n\nINT. QUICHO POLICE STATION - NIGHT\n\nThe station is small. It's made up of a large bullpen area,\nQuicho's single jail cell, and Marty's office, which looks\nout on the bullpen.",

HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nMarty walks up the walkway to a small house. Before he gets\nthere, the door opens. ANN HARRISON stands in the doorway,\nwearing just an oversized t-shirt.\n\nAnn is beautiful -- especially by Quicho's standards. She's\nMarty's age, but even if he kept up his New Years's\nresolutions she'd probably be out of his league. If Ann's\nface couldn't launch a thousand ships, it could get at least\na couple hundred out of the harbor.\n\nMarty takes a long, less than professional, look at Ann as he\nwalks into the house.\n\nINT. ANN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\n\nA modest house. A lot of things are still boxed up. Can't\ntell whether Ann is moving in or moving out.\n\nMARTY\nDid you get a look at him, Ann?\n\nANN\nYeah. He's about your height,\nyour weight. Come to think of it,\nhe kinda looked like you.\n\nMARTY\nSo he was good looking.\nANN\nNo. :\n\nMarty stares at her for a beat. She stares right back. A\nsmile escapes from her full lips.\n\nANN\nSorry. Just not my type.\n\nMARTY\n(under his breath)\nWell, bony dyed blondes aren't my\ntype.\n\fWhat?\nMARTY\n{out loud)\nSo -- this ugly man -- do you know\n\nhow he got in the house?\n\nANN\nThe bedroom window.\n\nMarty follows her into the bedroom.\nBEDROOM\nMarty checks the windows.

Ann starts to moan.\n\nANN\nI'm sorry, I was confused. He\nripped my shirt off.\n\nMarty rips her shirt down the middle, exposing her breasts.\nHe licks at her breasts, teasing them with his tongue. Ann\nmoans in pleasure.\n\nMARTY\n\nYou didn't put up much of a fight.\nANN\n\nOh, really?\n\nAnn flips Marty over so that she's on top of him. She\nfumbles with his belt, kicks his pants off of him. She rips\nopen his shirt -- the buttons fly off. In seconds, they're\nboth naked.\n\nAnn straddles Marty.... grinds her hips into him... She\narches her back, pushes her breasts into his face... He pulls\nher closer to him... Pushes deeper inside of her...\n\nThe bed starts to shake. The springs squeak. Sweat begins\nto pour off of them as they claw at each other.\n\fut\n\nThey groan leuder, both racing toward climax. As they move\ntogether in perfect rhythm we...\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\nINT.

As Marty\nwalks back to his truck, he lowers his mask. It kills him\nthat Ann is married to Chris.\n\nIn the b.g. Chris peels back onto the highway.
