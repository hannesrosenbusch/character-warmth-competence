CHURCHYARD -- AFTERNOON\nA stiff WIND.  A BRIDE angrily drags her ass out of a church and into its courtyard.\nTrees bend their bare, twisted limbs as if to lynch her: snagging her gown, catching at the layers of tulle over her face.  She fights them off and storms on.  Behind her, TWO MEN try to keep up, the Wind chasing the tails of their morning coats.  \nThe men--tall, aristocratic UNCLE ERNEST and MAMMY, his gentler, younger, queenier male companion--collapse on a bench, while the bride, LEILA SWEET, 18, paces in front of them. Mammy silently reads a letter. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMAMMY\n\n\n\n\nWell, his note claims he's ... dead.\n\n\n\n\nA scowling Ernest rips it out of his hand. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNCLE ERNEST\n\n\n(beat)\n\nBut he signed it, right?\n\n\n\n\nThe answer's written on Mammy's sympathetic face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNCLE ERNEST (CONT'D)\n\n\n\n\nAnd he dotted the \"I\" in his name with a little happy face?\n\n\n\n\nCan't argue with the facts.\nFrom ABOVE we see the young bride.  Her uncles stand around her awkwardly.  The uncommon Wind stirs the leaves on the ground.  CRANE UP off Leila's face to an ASKEW ANGLE: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEILA\n\n\n\n\nOn my parents' grave, before God, never again will I let some lying clown tell me he loves me, much less agree to marry him for it.\n\n\n\n\nUncle Ernest steps forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNCLE ERNEST\n\n\n\n\nNonsense.\n\n\n\n\n\nLEILA\n\n\n\n\nI'll die first.\n\n\n\n\n\nUNCLE ERNEST\n\n\n\n\nYou'll go to Harvard first.\n\n\n\n\nThe camera WIDENS to reveal a trail of clothes leading down the courtyard path through the church's outer gates: dark pants, cummerbund, suspenders, tailed jacket, bow tie, dress shirt and shoes.

A planet-themed mobile stands on a table in the living area.\nLeila slaps the Post-It next to another on the fridge that reads \"WEDDING!\".  And one which reads \"GET A GRIP!\".  She pulls out a carton of milk, and a bottle of Vitamin C, chugs both from their containers, and pushes the message button on the answering machine.
