CHURCH LETTERBOARD SIGN - DAY\n\nAn old, wooden sign in front of an equally old but sturdy,\nsalt of the earth church with a towering steeple. This is the\nGRACE BAPTIST CHURCH of Gatlin, Nebraska and the sign\nproclaims the topic of today's sermon: CORN DROUGHT AND THE\nLORD\n\nCAMERA PANS\n\nAs the choir music continues, picking up the DOORS TO THE\nCHURCH as they open to allow the CONGREGATION to exit.\n\nANGLE - A CHILD'S POV\n\nWe see only the legs of pants and hems of dresses from this\nlittle person's perspective. The parishioners are in their\n\"Sunday\" clothes. We don't see the upper bodies or faces.\nOVER THIS SHOT we hear:\n\nJOB (VO)\nI don't remember everything that\nhappened cuz I was only five then\nand now I'm eight.\n\nANGLE - THE CHURCH ENTRANCE\n\nAn adorable little boy of about five, his hand firmly in the\ngrasp of an adult's hand, is led out of the church. This is\nJOB, and he is dressed appropriately for worship. He comes up\nto his father's waist, and this is all we see of the father\nand the MINISTER in front of whom the father stops for a\nBEAT. Job stands there looking around while his father\napparently talks with the minister. Legs continue to file out\npast them.\n\nJOB (VO)\nI was about the only kid in church\nthat day, on account of all the\nother kids had been excused to go\nlisten to Isaac, who was this boy\npreacher who'd come to Gatlin a few\ndays before.\n\nANGLE - JOB\n\nAN ADULT, also whom we only see from the WAIST DOWN, bangs\ninto Job, who goes flying but doesn't fall because the\nstrong hand of his father hangs on to him and lifts him into\nthe air, setting him back down in place again.\n\fTHE HAND of THE MAN WHO BUMPED HIM gives Job a vigorous but\napologetic rub across the hair.",

Dad\ndecided to take me so he could talk\nabout the drought with some of the\nother men. That's all everybody was\ntalking about then, the drought.\n\nANGLE\n\nFather finishes his brief conversation with the minister and\nstarts down the steps with Job. It's hard for little Job to\nkeep up with his dad and he's constantly whisked off his feet\nwhenever he lags too far behind.\n\nINT. HANSEN'S COFFEE SHOP - JOB'S POV\n\nThe door is pushed open by the unseen hand of his father and\nJob is led into the coffee shop. Hansen's is a small,\ncomfortable, homey place that caters strictly to the locals.\nThe furnishings are modest but everything is clean and neat\nBooths with red vinyl cushioning line the walls and the floor\nholds eight or ten tables. There are also stools at the\nFormica counter, behind which MR. and MRS. HANSEN work\nbusily.\n\nANGLE\n\nThe coffee shop is crowded, mostly with ADULTS but also with\nA HALF DOZEN BOYS between the ages of 15 and 18. The two\nwaitresses, SALLY and MARIE HANSEN, are about 17. They are\nbeing kept quite busy.\n\nANGLE\n\nFour of the boys are crowded around a video MACHINE.

JOB'S FAMILY HOUSE\n\nSARAH, an angelic blonde haired girl of four years, is\ntossing and turning in bed. Her face is feverish and flushed.\n\nANGLE - INCLUDING SARAH\n\nHER MOTHER is visible in another room on the phone, talking\nwith her husband, Job and Sarah's father. Semi-conscious in\nher fever, Sarah spills a box of CRAYONS and clutches a BLACK\none.

COFFEE SHOP\n\nJob is sucking with all his might on a straw protruding from\nthe strawberry shake. He glances towards his father.\nSomething catches his eyes and causes him to FREEZE.\n\nEXT. THRU FRONT WINDOW - JOB'S POV - DAY\n\nThru the window, beyond his father, beyond the boys by the\nPac Man machine, stands ISAAC. A gaunt boy of 12, he has a\nface right out of the Old Testament and eyes that burn like\ncoal. He is dressed in black robes and a wide-brimmed hat. He\nis staring into - through -the coffee shop.\n\nINT. COFFEE SHOP\n\nThe straw slips out of Job's mouth.

BURT STANTON, an\nattractive young man of 28, is lying in bed fast asleep.\n\nANGLE\n\nSomeone is sneaking through the room towards Burt.
