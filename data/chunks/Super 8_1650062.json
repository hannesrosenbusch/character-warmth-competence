Then the house BACK DOOR bursts\n\n          open -- Joe cranes his neck -- and what he sees he'll never\n\n          forget: his father, Jack, leading an in-pain and HAND-CUFFED\n\n          Louis Dainard from the house and into the rear of the squad\n\n          car. When he slams the back door, he sees Joe. Sort of\n\n          freezes as their eyes lock.
