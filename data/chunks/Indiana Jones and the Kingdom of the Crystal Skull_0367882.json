The kids\nLAUGH and the music cranks as they barrel down the road, don’t\ncare where they’re going, just want to get there fast.\n\nUp ahead, there are four military vehicles, a ‘51 Ford staff car,\ntwo jeeps, and a large panel truck. There are THREE U.S.\nSOLDIERS in the lead car, TWO MORE in each of the jeeps, anda\nDRIVER for the truck.\n\nThe hot rod pulls up close behind the convoy, then swerves into\nthe passing lane and guns it, passing the truck and jeeps and\npulling up even with the lead car\n\nThe DRIVER of the lead car hits the gas too, not about to let\nthese punks pass him -- drag race!\n\nThe cars drive flat out, nobody backing off. But then the ARMY\nCOLONEL in the passenger seat of the lead car puts a hand on the\nDriver’s arm and gestures to a road up ahead -- we go that way.\nThe military vehicles veer to the right, off the main road, and\nthe Guys and Girls in the Chevy WHOOP in triumph as they barrel\naway down the road in a cloud of dust, the winners in this race.\nBut we follow the Army convoy, rising up behind them to get a look\nat where they’re headed -- toward a remote military outpost in\nthe distance.
