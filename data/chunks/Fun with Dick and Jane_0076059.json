The whole style\nof the opening should be a kind of kiddy-version of those\n\"Book Openings'' to old MGM movies. Like this...\n\nMUSIC AND TITLES CONTINUE. We blow open to the first page\nwhere the story begins. This page is labeled, \"DICK\" at\nthe bottom and the picture on the page is of a young boy\nof about ten sitting under a tree reading \"IVANHOE.\" In\nthe background is a large, comfortable house. (NOTE: All\nthe pictures in the book are in that romanticized and naive\nstyle unique to the Dick and Jane Series. But we shall\nuse the real childhood photos of our stars, Jane Fonda and\nGeorge Segal.)\n\nAnother page turns and we SEE a picture of Dick's father,\na rugged but gentle, distinguished but earthy, fun but\nserious, neat but casual guy, standing on the front porch\nof the house holding a football and shouting to his son,\nDick, who has. dropped his book and is looking eagerly at\nhis father. Beneath the picture are these words... *\n\n\"LOOK, DICK,\" SAID DICK'S\nFATHER. .\"LOOK WHAT I HAVE.\"\n\nAnother page blows open. The ball has been thrown and\nDick is running after it.
