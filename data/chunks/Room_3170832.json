She\n\n    cranes up at the recessed skylight, Room's only window.\n\n\n\n    The irregular flashes of lamp-light reveal glimpses of this\n\n    little world lined with cork: ten foot a side, seven foot\n\n    high, gabled ceiling rising to ten foot.\n\n\n\n    Clusters of Jack's and Ma's vivid drawings are pinned all\n\n    over the walls, quivering in the draft from the vents. Done\n\n    with five crayons (red, yellow, blue, orange, green) and\n\n    pencil on toilet tissue, lined pages or cardboard, they show\n\n    dogs, trees, aliens, rocket ships, figures labelled 'Jack' or\n\n    'Ma'. Delicate mobiles (uncooked spaghetti, threads,\n\n    plastics, foil, down from pillows, cloth scraps) dangle.\n\n\n\n    A wardrobe with slatted louver doors. On top, toys crafted\n\n    from garbage, a Labyrinth from toilet-roll insides.\n\n\n\n    A dresser with a TV. A homemade pack of cards, papier mâché\n\n    checkers and chess. A Fort constructed from vitamin and other\n\n    bottles and cans. A single meagre African violet in a pot on\n\n    the TV.\n\n\n\n    A round dining table, two fold-up chairs side by side.\n\n\n\n    A bath with a single small towel over the side.\n\n    A toilet, with a flotilla of homemade toy boats floating in\n\n    the tank which is oddly missing a lid.\n\n\n\n    A sink, with a single worn toothbrush, toothpaste, dish soap,\n\n    a broken comb, folded rags for washcloths.

A cot bed, unused, has been set up to one\n\n      side. Jack is awake but content to lie close to Ma for a\n\n      while - studying the dials and switches on the wall above his\n\n      head. He looks at Ma, asleep, bruises fading to yellow-green.\n\n      He sits up and pulls back the sheet. He's wearing only a pair\n\n      of underpants from Room which look particularly wretched in\n\n      this new antiseptic environment. He touches the part of the\n\n      mattress he's being lying on. It's damp. He examines a\n\n      bandage on his knee. He gets up. On a side table, he sees a\n\n      plate with the remains of some toast on it and a half drunk\n\n      cup of tea. He sniffs at the food. There are two surgical\n\n      masks there, also. He walks slowly to the opposite wall, his\n\n      little figure silhouetted against the translucent blinds. He\n\n      stops in front of the one window which has its blind drawn.\n\n      The hospital suite is high up and the view is spectacular.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                        (CONTINUED)\n\n45   CONTINUED:                                               45\n\n\n\n     From the back we study Jack's small figure and beyond it the\n\n     vast world below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n\n45   CONTINUED: (2)                                           45\n\n\n\n     Coming around on Jack's face we see that he is trying to make\n\n     sense of what he's seeing.
