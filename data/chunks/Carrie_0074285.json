It's the\n\n\n\n   EXT. WHITE BUNGALOW (OR HOUSE) ­ DAY\n\n\n\n1. FILLING THE FRAME like a picture postcard. Modest, old-fashioned,\n\n   spotless ­ a vision of small town normalcy and virtue.\n\n\n\n   This is the home of MARGARET WHITE and her daughter CARRIE. It seems\n\n   to have been scrubbed from roof to porch; it is white. Even the lawn seems to\n\n   have been washed and bleached. Antiseptic.\n\n\n\n   We hear a woman's voice:\n\n\n\n                                 MARGARET (o.s.)\n\n                          Carrie! Carrie\n\n\n\n   The voice is distant but insistent. It is heard, in perspective, through the following prologue,\n\n   which initially involves:\n\n\n\n2. STELLA HORAN ­ DAY\n\n\n\n   An all-American sunbathing beauty of eighteen, getting the tan of her life with only a skimpy\n\n   white bikini running interference between her skin and the sun.\n\n\n\n   The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS OVER the expanse of her body ­ luxuriant, taking it in\n\n   inch for inch as she dreamily rubs in suntan lotion and licks her lips. The MUSIC is coming\n\n   from a transistor radio by her side; she's on a beach blanket in the Horan back yard.\n\n\n\n3. DOWNWARDS ANGLE ­ STELLA\n\n\n\n   As she senses someone standing over her, someone staring at her body through the half-\n\n   grown hedge which separates the Horan back yard from the White house next door.\n\n\n\n                                VOICE (O.S.)\n\n                          What are those?\n\n                                                                                                    2\n\n\n\n4. STELLA'S POV ­ CARRIE WHITE\n\n\n\n  A terribly appealing little girl, a child of indeterminable age. Pink cheeks, a halo of blonde-\n\n  white hair which will darken in time. What sets her apart from other children, however, are a\n\n  pair of bright button brown eyes; and it's these eyes that we notice as she peers at Stella\n\n  through the hedge.\n\n\n\n                                STELLA\n\n                         Hiya, Carrie.",

She looks\n\n  quickly to Stella, then back at the White house, then back to Stella. For the merest flash, she\n\n  seems to smile ­ or is she about to cry?\n\n\n\n  And then, she's gone ­ running around the hedge and then up the porch stairs and into the\n\n  White house as fast her legs can carry her.\n\n\n\n10. STELLA\n\n\n\n  Stands there, riveted. Not knowing what's happened, what to do. It's utterly silent for a\n\n  moment.\n\n\n\n  And then, an incredible CACOPHONY of strange sounds starts coming from the White\n\n  house ­ an unearthly babble as Margaret White screams, rants, and screeches; as Carrie sobs\n\n  that she's sorry, that she forgot.\n\n\n\n                               STELLA\n\n                         Mother!\n\n                               (louder)\n\n                         Mother!\n\n                                                                                                     5\n\n\n\n11.

She\n\n   sorts through magazines and books, discarding some, putting others into cartons. And she\n\n   comes across the religious tracts left behind by Margaret White, forgotten until now. They\n\n   have a momentary hypnotic effect on her.\n\n\n\n   The phone RINGS, startling her. She rushes to answer it in the kitchen, catching it on the first\n\n   or second ring.\n\n\n\n                          ELEANOR\n\n                          (hushed voice)\n\n                  Hello?

She proceeds to try\n\n   to wipe off the red chalk with the palm of her hand; it smudges badly.\n\n\n\n   She stares at her hand, fixating on it, remembering Carrie in the shower. Suddenly, a second\n\n   hand thrusts into frame, onto her nightgown.\n\n\n\n   A bloody hand.\n\n\n\n   A hand from the Earth itself.\n\n\n\n   Carrie's hand\n\n\n\n   It clutches a horrified Sue by the wrist.
