They are both dressed in\nunkempt winter clothes and look dishevelled.\n\nThe camera is behind them now as Nandu and Brian awkwardly\nstruggle to hoist a dead body wrapped in a sheet into the\ntrunk. It does not fit. Nandu holds on to the feet that stick\nout in an awkward position.\n\nBRIAN\n(Holding onto the head)\nWhy don’t you bend the knees, like\nin a foetal position?\n\nThey exchange a look.
