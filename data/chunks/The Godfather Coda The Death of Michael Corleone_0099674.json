Now,\n\n          confusingly, we see a slant of light move past us\n\n          and another, and as our surroundings become more\n\n          visible, we discover that we are moving through a\n\n          pine forest lit by shafts of morning sunlight. Now,.\n\n          suddenly, we come out of the trees and find ourselves\n\n          on the Nevada shore of Lake Tahoe.\n\n\n\n          It is a clear, cold morning in September of Nineteen\n\n          Fifty-nine. We now see the Corleone compound at\n\n          lakeside, half-hidden by pines and firs. We move\n\n          toward it, past the gates and guard houses, past\n\n          the guest houses, past the kennels for the guard\n\n          dogs, and finally to the front driveway of the main\n\n          house where a conservative sedan is being loaded by\n\n          a Chauffeur and a pair. of large dark-headed men named\n\n          Al Neri and Rocco Lampone. Rocco limps slightly.\n\n          As suitcases are being placed in the trunk of the\n\n          car, the front door to the main house opens and Tom\n\n          Hagen, a trim, serious, balding man in a business\n\n          suit, appears He crosses to the corner of the house\n\n          and looks off.\n\n\n\n          HAGEN'S POINT OF VIEW - THE LAKE AND LKSIDE\n\n          Standing by the shore of the lake is a little boy,.\n\n          Tony Adams Corleone, aged about ten.
