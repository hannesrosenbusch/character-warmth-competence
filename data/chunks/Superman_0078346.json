She is tall and has a magnificent body which is shown to its best advantage in a Krypton outfit that reveals more than it conceals: high boots, a clinging body suit, and all shiny black. Long raven hair frames a strikingly beautiful face; her eyes are almost fiery in their grace. A woman whose beauty makes strong men weak, she is consumed by total hatred of the male sex. This is URSA.\n\nOne of the men, who struts and swaggers like the leader, is got up in a Kryptonian version of ultra-military attire - Jackboots, high collar, uniform. All this, however, is belied by his pasty-faced, even sickly appearance. A pathological dictator, as super-Fascist whose only quality is utter contempt for everyone but himself, whose only goal is to command a world of inferiors. This is GENERAL ZOD. \n\nThe second man is a thin, wiry character whose face seems to be permanently contorted into a twisted, mocking grin. There is something seedy and second-rate about his appearance, even as his clothing is flashier, gaudier and, finally, more vulgar than the others. A psychopathic jokester, whose pranks and \"practical jokes\" are only funny to him when they cause death and suffering to others, this is JAK-EL.\n\nThe fourth member of the band is only a man to the extent that he is not an animal. A monstrous brute, his ugly face twists with violence. He does not speak but instead utters horrible animal-like growls and howls. Almost pure if, bent only on mindless destruction, he is a force of frightening evil. This is NON.\n\nFADE IN\n\n283EXT.
