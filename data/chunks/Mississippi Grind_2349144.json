RIVERBOAT CASINO PARKING LOT - IOWA - NIGHT 1\n\nOutrageous flashing lights sparkle in the reflection of the\nwindshield of a 2003 Subaru station wagon. Slumped behind the\nwheel is GERRY KARTWELL (early-40s, mustached). He listens to\nJoe Navarro’s audio book of “200 Poker Tells” on CD.\n\nJOE NAVARRO’S VOICE\nNinety-eight. Furrowing of Forehead.\nFurrowing of the forehead is a good\nindicator that something is amiss or\nthe person is insecure. It is also\nseen when people are concentrating or\ntrying to make sense of something.\n\nCLOSE ON Gerry, glassy-eyed, perhaps fighting back tears.\nJOE NAVARRO’S VOICE (CONT’D)\n\nIt is usually associated with doubt,\n\nweakness, or concern.\nGerry looks in his rearview mirror, contorts and relaxes his\nface in a tension-releasing exercise. He does this several\ntimes, until he’s ready.\nINT. CASINO BATHROOM - SAME 2\n\nWe are behind the shaggy hair of a bearded man. He brushes his\nteeth, leans over the sink and spits.\n\nINT.

You like that one?\n\nWe ZOOM past Gerry at the table to reveal the bearded drifter\napproaching in the background.\n\nThis man is CURTIS VONN (30s, handsome with a devil-may-care\nattitude). We reverse ZOOM back to Gerry at the table, where\nthe conversation continues...\n\nGERRY\n\nAnyone see that rainbow yesterday?\nCLIFFORD\n\nMissed it.\nLARRY\n\nI drove to the end of a rainbow once.\nGERRY\n\nYeah?\nLARRY\n\nWasn't nothin’ there.
