Beneath those flowers and plants is a dark\n\n               and mysterious forest, shaded by huge leaves, and broken up\n\n               by towering boulders. Mounted figures of medieval knights\n\n               ride in, guided by BILL'S gigantic hand. A wizard appears\n\n               in the path of the riders who draw up sharply. BILL gives\n\n               an impression of neighing horses. SUE'S face looms up\n\n               between large leaves. She makes the sound of spooky wind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               INT.

But it\n\n               is only a silk handkerchief that he pulls out. He wipes his\n\n               hands, puts it away. He moves to an empty oil drum and sits\n\n               on it.

DAWN looks at her mother\n\n               accusingly.\n\n\n\n                                   DAWN\n\n                         You don't care if I die.

From time to time, a\n\n               silicosis NEIGHBOUR goes over to her, offering help, but\n\n               PAULINE shakes her head and looks away.

SUE looks weepy. BILL mouths some of his\n\n               repertoire of swear words. From the dormer window, DAWN\n\n               witnesses their humiliation. She laughs and waves. As\n\n               GRANDFATHER GEORGE turns back to the house, she ducks out of\n\n               sight.\n\n\n\n               EXT.

BILL cheers louder\n\n               than anyone. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\n He remembers his grandfather, turns on his heel\n\n               and runs back to the road.\n\n\n\n               EXT. SCHOOL - DAY\n\n\n\n               GRANDFATHER GEORGE is awkwardly turning the car in the road.\n\n               He drives off. BILL runs flat out and comes up to the window,\n\n               shouting.\n\n\n\n                                   BILL\n\n                         Grandpa! There's no school!

A fire engine and ARP\n\n               vehicles race up to the school. They pass GRANDFATHER GEORGE\n\n               and doubt shows in is face. He stops, gets out. Boys are\n\n               spilling out of school, cheering. BILL runs up to him.\n\n\n\n                                   BILL\n\n                         It's true.\n\n\n\n                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE\n\n                         You're much more convincing when\n\n                         you're making it up.\n\n\n\n               They get into the car.\n\n\n\n                                   BILL\n\n                         Grandpa, if you think of something\n\n                         hard enough, can you make it\n\n                         happen?\n\n\n\n                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE\n\n                         Apparently so.\n\n\n\n               A barking laugh wells up and escapes his throat. It bursts\n\n               forth in great waves like a flood that has been dammed up for\n\n               years.\n\n\n\n               EXT. RIVER - DAY\n\n\n\n               GRANDFATHER GEORGE's laugh, and BILL's too, ring out over the\n\n               autumn river which beckons to BILL with the promise of stolen\n\n               days.\n\n\n\n               THE EN]D\n\n\n\n\n"
