LARS'S GARAGE APT. -- MORNING\nEstablishing.\nINT. LARS'S GARAGE APT. -- MORNING\n\nLars is dressed for church. He wears an old, hand-knitted\npaby blanket like a shawl. He looks out the window, watches\nsmoke rise from the chimneys in the neighborhood. He watches\nthe family next door--husband, wife, children--in an ordinary\nSunday morning routine. His breath mists the glass.\n\nHis rooms are sterile: bed, computer, one bowl, one plate,\none cup; furniture he must have grown up with. We see a\nwedding picture of his parents, a wedding picture of his\nbrother Gus and his sister-in-law Karin.\n\nEXT. LINDSTROM HOUSE: BACKYARD -- CONTINUOUS\n\nFrom the main house, KARIN, early 30's, pregnant but not\nshowing yet, hurries across the backyard, past a big stack of\nfirewood, to the garage. She’s thrown a sweater over her\nbathrobe and wears slippers. She's the kind of woman who\nlooks good in cold weather and no make-up.\n\nINT. LARS’S GARAGE APT.--WINTER--CONTINUOUS\n\nLars opens the door. He’s awkward and nervous with her, and\nconcerned to see her in the cold.\n\nLARS\nKarin!\n\nKARIN\nI'm inviting you for breakfast.\n\nLars puts his blanket around her shoulders, careful not to\ntouch her.\n\nLARS\nSorry, I’m on my way to church.\n\n(CONTINUED)\n\f \n\nLARS by Nancy Oliver - 2.",

I\n\nsure did.\n\nHe pounces on her, making her laugh. They forget about Lars.\nWe hear church bells.\n\nEXT. CHURCH - MORNING\n\nA small Protestant church, friendly, not forbidding. We can\nhear sincere, bad Protestant singing.\n\nINT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS\n\nIt’s bright inside, white walls, stained glass, full of\nordinary working- and middle-class people.
