SMITH STREET STATION -- BROOKLYN -- NIGHT                 1\n\n\n\n    It's very late. It's quiet. Just the sounds of The City\n\n\n\n    LINDA SANTANA CRAIG, an attractive Hispanic woman in her\n\n    thirties, waits at the ELEVATED STATION for the F train.\n\n\n\n    Linda looks great. She's dressed festively but tastefully.\n\n    Next to her is her eleven year old DAUGHTER, ALICIA. She is\n\n    twirling about the platform, still jazzed from the birthday\n\n    party they attended in The City.\n\n\n\n    Alicia wears a black dress with a pink cardigan and has a pink\n\n    handbag. We notice a CHARM BRACELET with four-leaf clovers on\n\n    her right wrist.\n\n\n\n    The mother and daughter wait alone at one end of the station\n\n    platform.\n\n\n\n    TWO TEENAGE BOYS wait at the other end. They speak soft,\n\n    SLURRED SPANISH to each other.\n\n\n\n    Linda gives the boys a glance and evaluates. She watches them\n\n    as Alicia spits a wad of gum into her mom's open hand.\n\n\n\n    The Boys approach. Linda tenses. At the last second the boys\n\n    make a hard left turn and disappear down the stairwell. It's\n\n    quiet again. Linda relaxes, smiles at her daughter. The F\n\n    TRAIN is rounding the final bend into the station.\n\n\n\n    Their focus is on this train. It's getting closer, louder.\n\n\n\n    And so they don't see, don't hear the Boys coming back up the\n\n    stairwell behind them.\n\n\n\n    Not until the boys have the mother and daughter boxed in and\n\n    the one who can hardly grow a mustache is showing them his\n\n    gun.\n\n\n\n    Linda puts her arm around her daughter. Alicia looks\n\n    terrified.\n\n\n\n    The train roars INTO THE STATION as Linda quickly hands over\n\n    her purse, her watch. She hands over her engagement ring and\n\n    her wedding band.\n\n\n\n    One of the boys yanks Alicia's little purse away from her.\n\n\n\n    The other boy fumbles the wedding band.",

Who does she think she is?\n\n\n\n    -- THE TRAIN DOORS BEGIN TO CLOSE --\n\n\n\n    When a HAND WITH TATTOOED KNUCKLES reaches out and stops the\n\n    car doors from closing.\n\n\n\n    A forearm and gun extend out of that last subway car ...\n\n    There's a muzzle flash... a distant POP... a cloud of smoke\n\n    ... a mist of blood... and Linda's body collapses on itself.\n\n\n\n    Alicia's face, shock, terror and blood.\n\n\n\n\n\n2   EXT.

Late thirties, big,\n\n    plain clothes, he is SERGEANT JAMES CRAIG. When he reaches\n\n    the platform, he stops.\n\n\n\n    Craig kneels before the white sheet. Peels it back. We stay\n\n    on him. We don't see what he sees. We just see how he sees\n\n    it. Then he turns...\n\n\n\n    THE WEDDING BAND. It's been tagged and numbered as evidence.\n\n    Craig picks it right out of the chalk outline and slips it\n\n    into his pocket.\n\n\n\n    Alicia, wrapped in a blanket, standing next to a round police\n\n    MATRON. The Matron is tenderly trying to clean Alicia's face.\n\n    Alicia locks eyes with Craig and stumbles towards him, her\n\n    legs not quite working.\n\n\n\n    Craig saves her from the stumble and envelops her, lifting\n\n    her as the blanket falls to the ground.",
