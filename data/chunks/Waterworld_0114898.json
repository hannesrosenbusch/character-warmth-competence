A familiar image, but\nsomething about it is different. There are no continents. No\nland whatsoever. Only water. Nothing but water.\n\nWE BEGIN MOVING in on the blue globe. Descending into it, as if\non a spaceship. Closer and closer. Now the screen is filled\nwith blueness.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nTHE OCEAN\n\nA sweeping panorama of waves kissed by the golden halo of\n\nsunrise. Sublime and balmy. Not a vessel in sight. WE BEGIN\nto pan along the gently curving horizon. Empty ocean in every\ndirection. Now, at the end of our 360° pan, we finally REVEAL:\n\n“OASIS.”\n\nA floating comminity. Several dozen vessels of all shapes and\nsizes tied together -- bow to stern -- ina large ring. They\nare connected by planks and bridges.\n\nWE MOVE CLOSER. There are boats of every description -- tugs,\ntrawlers, Chinese junks, river barges. Most are simply\n“houseboats\" for the various families, but others seem to be\nrigged for communal needs like the “Barterboat\" with its\nelectricity-generating windmill, the \"Schoolboat\" which doubles\nas a chapel, and the \"Vegetable Barge,“ where rows of bizarre-\nlooking hybrid seaweed are growing in special hydroponic tanks.\n\nIN THE WATER - NEAR A SLOOP.\n\nAn angelic, though impish GIRL of twelve is scraping barnacles\nfrom the hull, collecting them in a basket. This is ENOLA. She\ngrabs a fat one and sucks out the meat.\n\nVOICE\nEnola...",
