She is\nquickly ensnared by her persistent troubling thoughts.\n\nON Matty...\n\nAs he looks at her and grins with impulse and a veteran’s\nsense of mischief based on deep appreciation of the night,\nher swirling skirt and the promise of simple pleasures. He\ncomes up behind her ear and responds to her yelp with the\nabsolute truth.\n\nMATTY\nNight's so great. You look so good.\nJust need to grab you.\n\nLISA\nHuh. .Sorry I didn‘t..\n\nBut that quick he has lifted and swirled her.
