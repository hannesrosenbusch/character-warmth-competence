Fauchelevent screams as the cart slowly sinks in\n\n     the   mud.\n\n\n\n     Valjean, Javert and Javert's assistant all hurry to help,\n\n     but they can't get a proper purchase in the spongy ground.\n\n     All the time the cart is sinking further, pushing\n\n     Fauchelevent deeper into the mud that will soon bury him.\n\n     Then Valjean sees a way. At one end the wheels of the cart\n\n     have stopped sinking - the ground is harder here. He throws\n\n     himself under the cart at this higher end, and braces\n\n     himself to lift it from beneath.\n\n\n\n                           VALJEAN\n\n                 Get back!
