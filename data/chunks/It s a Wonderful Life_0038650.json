Why?\n\n\n\n               George is at the door of the office, holding his coat and \n\n               papers, ready to leave.\n\n\n\n                                     GEORGE\n\n                         Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter. \n\n                         You have all the papers there. His \n\n                         salary, insurance. I can personally \n\n                         vouch for his character.\n\n\n\n                                     POTTER\n\n                              (sarcastically)\n\n                         A friend of yours?\n\n\n\n                                     GEORGE\n\n                         Yes, sir.\n\n\n\n                                     POTTER\n\n                         You see, if you shoot pool with some \n\n                         employee here, you can come and borrow \n\n                         money. What does that get us? A \n\n                         discontented, lazy rabble instead of \n\n                         a thrifty working class. And all \n\n                         because a few starry-eyed dreamers \n\n                         like Peter Bailey stir them up and \n\n                         fill their heads with a lot of \n\n                         impossible ideas. Now, I say...\n\n\n\n               George puts down his coat and comes around to the table, \n\n               incensed by what Potter is saying about his father.\n\n\n\n                                     GEORGE\n\n                         Just a minute  just a minute. Now, \n\n                         hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right \n\n                         when you say my father was no business \n\n                         man. I know that. Why he ever started \n\n                         this cheap, penny-ante Building and \n\n                         Loan, I'll never know. But neither \n\n                         you nor anybody else can say anything \n\n                         against his character, because his \n\n                         whole life was... Why, in the twenty-\n\n                         five years since he and Uncle Billy \n\n                         started this thing, he never once \n\n                         thought of himself. Isn't that right, \n\n                         Uncle Billy?  He didn't save enough \n\n                         money to send Harry to school, let \n\n                         alone me.",

What'd you say \n\n                         just a minute ago?... They had to \n\n                         wait and save their money before \n\n                         they even ought to think of a decent \n\n                         home. Wait! Wait for what? Until \n\n                         their children grow up and leave \n\n                         them?  Until they're so old and broken-\n\n                         down that they...

Just remember \n\n                         this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble \n\n                         you're talking about... they do most \n\n                         of the working and paying and living \n\n                         and dying in this community.

Anyway, my \n\n                         father didn't think so.

George picks up Zuzu to \n\n               protect her from the mob.

Each one comes forward with money. In their pockets, \n\n               in shoe boxes, in coffee pots. Money pours onto the table  \n\n               pennies, dimes, quarters, dollar bills  small money, but \n\n               lots of it. Mrs. Bailey and Mrs. Hatch push toward George. \n\n               More people come in. The place becomes a bedlam. Shouts of \n\n               \"Gangway  gangway\" as a new bunch comes in and pours out \n\n               its money. Mary stands next to George, watching him. George \n\n               stands there overcome and speechless as he holds Zuzu. As he \n\n               sees the familiar faces, he gives them sick grins.
