SMALL\n\nAUDITORIUM -- DAY\n\n\n\nAbout forty WORSHIPPERS, most in their 20s and 30s. Danny\n\nslips into the back, spots Carla up front with Miriam and\n\nStuart. He's shocked, appalled....\n\n\n\nCARLA -- trying to follow along the prayer book, suddenly\n\nDanny is leaning over her shoulder from the row behind.\n\n\n\n                    DANNY\n\n              (desperate whisper)\n\n          What are you doing here?\n\n\n\nPeople sitting nearby HUSH him; he ignores them.\n\n\n\n                    CARLA\n\n          Miriam called, looking for you.

FOREST ROAD -- DAY, 1943\n\n\n\nThe Jewish father (played by Danny's father) is ripping open\n\nthe Sergeant's jugular as the soldiers shoot him. One of the\n\nsoldiers (who is now Danny) says:\n\n\n\n                    DANNY/NAZI SOLDIER\n\n          Kill them. Kill them all.\n\n\n\nThe soldiers begin firing.... But now, three Israeli\n\ncommandos appear, Danny, Avi and the security guard we saw\n\noutside. They fire Uzis at the Nazis, who fire back.\n\n\n\nDanny the Nazi soldier and Danny the Israeli commando fire\n\nat each other at point-blank range.",
