One District, the 13th, was\ndestroyed entirely. The other twelve barely survived.\n\nWhen it was over, The Capitol decreed that those twelve\nDistricts - as a brutal reminder of their treasonous\nrebellion ~ would forever suffer a punishment, once a year.\n\nIt was called The Hunger Games.\"\n\nAs those last words linger, we SMASH TO:\n\n.-.a nightmare.

Abandoned now, overgrown\nwith foliage, decaying, dead.\n\nWe run around a corner, our heart rate spiking -~ a KNIFE,\nhurtling at us out of nowhere. PFFFT! It buries itself into\nour left arm. The pain is searing. We falter...\n\nBut we have to keep running, have to get to safety. Our eyes\ndarting, looking for somewhere to hide--\n\nOld Coffee Shops, Ski Rental Shops, Yogurt shops - skeletal\nnow, covered in vegetation, their windows long since blown\naway. Death waiting inside all of them. Then:\n\nA SPEAR, thrown from what used to be a second-story window.\nWe DIVE OUT of its way. It just misses us. But we've landed\non that wounded arm. More searing pain.\n\nWe get to our feet. Please let this end. Behind us we hear\nVOICES YELLING: “Get him!\" We don't look back. Just can't.",
