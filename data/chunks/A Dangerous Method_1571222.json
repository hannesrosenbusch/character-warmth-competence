CARRIAGE - DAY\n\nA violent struggle is in progress: CLOSE on a man's thick,\nfleshy hand, as it grips the two slender wrists of a young\ngirl, who's trying desperately to free herself, grunting\nwith effort.\n\nA WIDER ANGLE shows us that there are three people in the\ncarriage, the third, a man in uniform on his knees in a corner\nhanging on to the girl's feet and lower legs as she jerks\n\nand flails like a landed fish. The GIRL is SABINA SPIELREIN,\n\na dark, slight young woman of 19, olive-skinned and beautiful,\nwith waist-length dark hair. The MAN gripping her wrists in\nher father NIKOLAI SPIELREIN, a large, coarse-looking, red-\nfaced Russian in his midforties, with a thick moustache.\n\nAbruptly, SABINA stops struggling; but the relief, palpable\non the faces of the two men, is short-lived: for SABINA begins\nto wail, terrible, broken-hearted sobs to freeze the blood.\n\nEXT.

I don't feel\nthe relationship between the two is\nquite as you've portrayed it, but\nI'm most grateful to you for animating\nthe subject in such a stimulating\nway.

I didn't\nrealise he could be so brutal and\nsanctimonious.\n\nSABINA\nHe's trying to find some way forward,\nso that we don't just have to tell\nour patients, this is why you are\nthe way you are; he wants to be able\nto say, we can show you what you\nmight want to become.\n\nFREUD\nPlaying God, in other words.

I'1l be seeing\nhim at the editorial meeting in Munich\nin November and I shall be perfectly\ncivil. To tell you the truth, what\nfinished him for me was all that\nbusiness about you, the lies, the\nruthless behaviour. I was very\nshocked.

First, this\nwas something traditionally done by\nall new kings, who didn't wish their\nfather's names to continue to be\npublic currency.\n\nFREUD\nIn much the same way as your article\nin the Yearbook fails to mention my\nname?\n\nThe atmosphere is becoming electric.\n\nJUNG\nYour name is so well-known, it hardly\nseemed necessary to mention it.\n\nFREUD\nDo go on.\n\nJUNG\nSecondly, Amenhopis only struck out\nthe first half of his father's name,\nAmenhotep, because, like the first\nhalf of his own name, it was shared\nby Amon, one of the gods he was\ndetermined to eliminate.\n\nFREUD\nAs simple as that?\n\nJUNG\nThe explanation doesn't seem to me\nunduly simple.\n\f76\n\n77\n\n78\n\nWHITE Revision - 4-22-10 81.",

JUNG bounds\nforward, gathers him up in his arms, carries him across the\nroom and lowers him gently on to one of the old brown sofas\nwhich line the walls.
