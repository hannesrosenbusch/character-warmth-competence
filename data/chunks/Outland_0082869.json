He sees the silent tableau\nin the bar and then he sees O'Niel across the room.\nHe is motionless,\n\nO'Niel starts to walk towards Sheppard. It is painful\nfor him to move. His progress is slow. He passes by\nthe silent patrons at the bar and the tables. He is\nhalfway across...then three quarters...and finally...\nhe reaches Sheppard.\n\nSheppard stands up.\n\nThe two men face each other, O'Niel starts to speak.\n\nO'NIEL\nSheppard...\n(pause)\nOh...fuck it.\n\nHe swings a round house right and absolutely decks\nSheppard.\n\nHe looks around and walks silently and deliberately out\nof the Leisure Club.\n\ncur TO:\n\nEXT.
