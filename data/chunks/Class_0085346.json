  "1": "Entre les Murs\n\n(The Class)\n\nWritten by\nLaurent Cantet, Robin Campillo and Frangois Bégaudeau\n\nBased on the novel\n\"Entre les murs\" by Frangois Bégaudeau\npublished by Verticales, 2006\n\nDirected par Laurent Cantet\n\nDeveloped with the backing of\nthe Centre National de la Cinématographie,\nthe Procirep\nand the European Union's Media Programme\n\fINT. CAFE — DAY\nThe first morning of the new school year.\n\nIn a Paris café, leaning on the bar, FRANCOIS, 35 or so,\npeacefully sips coffee. In the background, we can vaguely\nmake out a conversation about the results of the\npresidential election. Frangois looks at his watch and\nseems to take a deep breath as if stepping onto a stage.\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY\n\nFrangois comes out of the café. Across the street, we\ndiscover a large building whose slightly outdated fagade\nis not particularly welcoming. He walks over to the\nimposing entrance that bears the shield of the City of\nParis in wrought iron and beneath which we read “JAURES\nMIDDLE SCHOOL”. On the opposite sidewalk, coming from the\nother end of the street, a small group of teachers\nhurries towards the entrance. Frangois hears them joking.\n\nVINCENT\nHe’s a really great guy, not the back-\nslapping type but...\n\nFrangois greets them in passing.\n\nINT. CORRIDORS - SCHOOL - DAY\n\nWe discover the school’s deserted corridors. Through the\ndoorway of a classroom, Frangois sees a few cleaners who,\nin a very calm atmosphere, clean the tables and line them\nup neatly, wash the windows.. A short distance further on,\na man in overalls applies one last coat of paint to an\nadministrative notice board.\n\nINT. MEETING ROOM - DAY\n\nAround the principal in the meeting room, the teachers,\nold or new, introduce themselves briefly, as in a casting\nsession.\n\nHERVE\nHello, everybody, I'm Hervé.

I'm Gilles, I've been\nteaching mathematics for many years now.\nI'm retiring at the end of this year. I'd\nlike to wish the new arrivals plenty of\ncourage.\n\fFRANCOIS\nI'm Frangois. I teach French and I'm\nstarting my fourth year here. Welcome,\neverybody.\n\nThen the principal hands out the timetables, eliciting a\nfew sighs of satisfaction or disappointment.\n\nINT. STAFF ROOM - DAY\n\nIn the staff room, a new arrival listens to the succinct\ncomments of an older member of staff, OLIVIER, on the\ndifferent students in a second-year class as he runs\nthrough a list.\n\nOLIVIER\nNice, nice, not nice, not nice at all...\nHe's nice, not nice, watch him, not nice\nat all, nice, not nice, she's not nice at\nall.\n\nINT.

One of you comes up front.\n\nThings start to calm down.\n\nFRANCOIS\nRight, let's get one thing clear from the\nword go.. Hey! I want to get this clear\nfrom the start. We waste five minutes\nlining up outside, five coming up, five\nsettling down: fifteen minutes out of an\nhour. Do you realize what fifteen lost\nminutes means? With twenty-five hours a\nweek and thirty weeks in the year, we\nlose thousands of minutes. In other\nschools, they do a full hour. Imagine how\nfar ahead they get in a year.

Damien, who lives in\nArgentina?\n\nDAMIEN\nThe Argentites.\n\nFRANCOIS\nNo, you know that's not right, you watch\nsoccer on TV.

It's easy.\n\nFRANCOIS\n\nLook here, nobody's perfect. Besides,\n\"Austrian\" is not a very important word.\nIt refers to someone from the land of\nAustria, which is a pretty tiny country.\nWe can live without the word. For\nexample, can anyone name a famous\nAustrian?\n\nNot one hand is raised.\n\nBOUBACAR\nMozart. “Wolfang” Amadeus Mozart.\n\nFRANCOIS\nWhat do you call him?\n\nBOUBACAR\n“Wolfang” Amadeus Mozart.\n\nFRANCOIS\n\nHe could have been \"Wolfang\" maybe if he\nwere English, not Austrian. Mozart was\nAustrian, yes, but do you know any other\nfamous Austrians? So, basically, Austria\ncould vanish from the map and no one\nwould notice. But, seriously, it's a\ncountry south of Germany. So check a map,\nWey. You'll see where it is. Souleymane,\ncan you note the words too, like everyone\nelse?\n\nFrangois’ blatant insincerity inspires a few collusive\nsmiles in the class. Wey is delighted to have understood\nthat his teacher is joking.\n\nSOULEYMANE\nI forgot my things.\n\fFRANCOIS\nAnd no one can lend you some paper so you\ncan do it?\n\nSOULEYMANE\nNo, it’s okay, I'll do it at home.\n\nFRANCOIS\nYou'll do it at home.

Thanks.\n\nSouleymane, convinced that he has had the last word,\nseems fairly pleased with himself. Frangois turns to the\nlist of words on the board again.\n\nFRANCOIS\nAll right, let's move on to \"succulent\".\n\"Succulent\" is a word that we'll try to\nguess the meaning of.

I'm sorry, but losing a point\nor two isn't a real punishment. It can\ncreate a dangerous sense of impunity. For\nme, the idea's totally wrong-headed.\n\nPRINCIPAL\nIn that case, we could find a punishment\nwhere the students lose all their points\nin one go. But why bother with the points\nin that case?\n\nSOPHIE\nThat’s the whole problem.\n\nPRINCIPAL\nIt’s not simple.\n\nFRANCOIS\nYou know, what you call a sense of\nimpunity gives us room to maneuver. When\nyou're dealing with punishments that are\ncut and dried, you can't adapt them to\neach case.\n\f44,\n\nFREDERIC\nNo, I don't agree. The rules apply in the\nsame way to all the students. They break\nthem, they're punished. If not, why\nbother with rules?\n\nFRANCOIS\nMaybe, but dealing with extremely strict\nrules creates the greatest tension. Take\ncell phones, for instance.

The\nprice of a coffee has gone up from 40\ncentimes to 50 centimes. That may seem\npetty but since we drink several coffees\na day at 8, at 10 or at 4 in the\nafternoon, it works out at a lot.

That way, we can drink as much\ncoffee as we want without having to\n\ncount.\n\nPRINCIPAL\nMonsieur Pierre will be delighted to\nreply.\n\nMonsieur Pierre, the bursar, starts speaking shyly. All\nthe same, we can tell that nothing will stop him.\n\f45.\n\nMONSIEUR PIERRE\nYes. First of all, I'd like to remind you\nthat this machine was installed in 2001\nto replace a machine that needed the\nintervention of an outside company for\nrestocking, repairs, etc. It was very\nexpensive and not at all profitable. We\nswitched to the new machine which isn't\nprofitable yet.\n\nSOPHIE\nI'm sorry to hear that!\n\nUsed to the bursar’s endless speeches, the people present\nexchange embarrassed looks that Monsieur Pierre, his eyes\nglued to his notes, haughtily ignores.\n\nMONSIEUR PIERRE\nAnd so we increased the price of coffee\nby ten centimes to fifty centimes. There.\nThe thing has to be economically viable.\n\nSOPHIE\nIsn't anyone shocked by this?\n\nPRINCIPAL\nIt's clear and logical to me.\n\nINT.
