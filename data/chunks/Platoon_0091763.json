He's about 21. New meat. His face, unburned yet \n               by the sun, is tense, bewildered, innocent, eyes searching \n               for the truth.\n\n               They fall now on a heap of BODY BAGS in the back of the cart.  \n               Two soldiers begin loading them onto the plane.

Very happy, chatting it up.\n\n               They pass the newboys - and they shake their heads, their \n               eyes full of an almost mocking pity.\n\n                                     VETERANS\n                         Well I'll be dipped in shit - new \n                         meat!

Breathing too hard, pacing himself all wrong, \n               bumping into things, tripping, not quite falling, he looks \n               pathetic here in the naturalness of the jungle. An urban \n               transplant, slightly neurotic and getting more so.\n\n               His rucksack is coming apart as well, about 70 badly packed \n               pounds banging noisily.\n\n               Behind him BARNES now comes, the Platoon Sergeant.

The \n               kid cuts on - struggling but trying, on his last reserves of \n               strength, smashing almost straight forward through brush, \n               not even bothering to look ahead.

Another beat. Then suddenly the sounds of the jungle \n               shift - some of the animals dropping out. A different tone.  \n               A piece of wood is stepped on, a rustle of bush...\n\n               Chris sees something, lifts an edge of the towel to peek \n               out.\n\n               A shadow of a figure is frozen there in front of him about \n               15 yards. It looks like a man. But it doesn't move. At all. \n               It listens.\n\n               Chris, his heart in his mouth, tries to peer through it. \n               It's a bush. It has to be. No human being could stand that \n               still. His heartbeats are up. The moments take forever. But \n               deep down - somewhere in his psyche - he knows who it is.\n\n               The figure now shifts, ever so slightly - and moves. It IS a \n               human being. Oh my God!\n\n               Chris looks around. Tex seems like a mile away. Why doesn't \n               anyone fire! He casts a desperate look at his rifle, at his \n               grenades encrusted with mud, but in spite of all his training, \n               he is frozen with indecision and fear at the sight of his \n               enemy.\n\n               The figure seems to whisper something back, then turns and \n               comes down the trail. Now a second and third figure appear \n               behind him - all in helmets and packs. All coming right past \n               Chris' position. Ten yards.

As Barnes passes, \n               the men look at him, everybody quickly senses something is \n               wrong.\n\n               EXT. GARDNER'S POSITION - NIGHT\n\n               At one of the positions Doc is working feverishly to knock \n               the life back into Gardner who lies there, his shirt stripped \n               off on his cottage cheese belly. A huge sucking chest wound. \n               He's dying. You know it because he knows it. The eyes do the \n               talking, numb, terrorized yet strangely detached, accepting, \n               not protesting or concerned any longer.\n\n               Most of the ambush has assembled and is watching, Chris moving \n               in to see. Doc is mumbling to him, low key.\n\n                                     DOC\n                         Chopper's on the way Gardner, hang \n                         in there, you gonna be okay...\n\n               But Gardner seems unconcerned. Things are going on in his \n               head - who knows what. And in his eyes there are big tears \n               rolling. Then a morphine smile. A sort of goofy Gardner smile, \n               maybe thinking about Lucy Jean, who knows.

Ammo casing and canvas are piled over \n               it, and sandbags surround it. From the outside very little \n               sound can be heard as they go down through a trap door made \n               of ammo crates. Past a lookout (Adams) pulling security, \n               hitting a joint but alert. King motions to him, it's cool.\n\n               Inside is another world. Chris looking around amazed. It's \n               like a private cabaret for the 'heads' who are there cooling \n               out. Boxes of food from the States, beers, whiskey bottles, \n               crates functioning as tables, hammocks hanging from poles, \n               electric fans, tape decks, paraphernalia.\n\n               The boys are all dressed up in their Saturday night rags.  \n               The clothes are clean, the headbands, the medallions are \n               out, anything distinctive and individualistic. On the \n               tapedeck, Jefferson Airplane's 'Go Ask Alice'.\n\n               To Chris it is a new world. And RHAH, the resident head, \n               sitting there in all his finery puffing a huge burning red \n               bowl in a three foot long Montagnard pipe, seems to be the \n               lord of final judgment in this smoky underworld.\n\n               Across his naked chest, birds and snakes are tattooed.

It is so silent in comparison \n               to the racket from the battle across the forest. The Mist \n               clings to the trees, moist and lovely.

His helmet \n               gone, his hair hanging free, he is at his best now - alone. \n               He hears it. Somebody running through the jungle, about 100 \n               yards, boots on leaves, coming towards him.\n\n               He begins to move lateral to the sound.

Perhaps it was the man Chris first saw \n               at the airstrip when he came in-country. The same expression \n               of evil, of a man who has seen too much and died, but still \n               lives.\n\n               Chris feels an unnatural fear passing through him.\n\n               The Man stands, sucking on his cigarette, stretches.

Finally \n               there is a certain frustration to his actions; he has taken \n               such great pains to stay alive that the tuition he pays is \n               precisely to stay in this Jungle. Inevitably his time will \n               come - one way or another.\n\n               His eyes now follow the MEDIVAC CHOPPER upwards, whatever is \n               left of his shrunken soul yearning to go with it.\n\n               EXT/INT: PERIMETER #3 LZ CHOPPER - DAY\n\n               As the Chopper rises off the battlefield, Chris, who is \n               sitting at the edge so that he has a full view out the open \n               door, waves back at Rhah.\n\n               EXT.",

EXT. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n PERIMETER #3 - DAY\n\n               Rhah, at the edge of the treeline, vigorously shakes his \n               walking stick at him, his other hand a fist, waving them, \n               emitting his cry.\n\n                                     RHAH\n                         Baaaaaaaaa!!!!!!\n\n               Defiance.

Smashed on morphine, Chris looking out at the \n               waving ants below.\n\n               Now the trees, the skyline and the chopper is moving fast \n               over the devastation. The jungle forever locked in his memory, \n               Chris looks back, copious, quiet tears flowing from his eyes.\n\n                                     CHRIS (V.O.)\n                         I think now, looking back, we did \n                         not fight the enemy, we fought \n                         ourselves - and the enemy was in \n                         us... The war is over for me now, \n                         but it will always be there - the \n                         rest of my days. As I am sure Elias \n                         will be - fighting with Barnes for \n                         what Rhah called possession of my \n                         soul... There are times since I have \n                         felt like the child born of those \n                         two fathers... but be that as it \n                         may, those of us who did make it \n                         have an obligation to build again, \n                         to teach to others what we know and \n                         to try with what's left of our lives \n                         to find a goodness and meaning to \n                         this life...\n\n               The music surges now to its full strength as we replay bits \n               of film with each actor's name listed - some with silly, \n               clowning looks, others sober, haunted. Gardner, Tex, King, \n               Rhah, Lerner, Sanderson, Manny, Big Harold - all the boys... \n               and then Barnes staring quietly into the camera, and lastly \n               Elias - shirt off, bowl of grass in hand, his big, beautiful \n               smile.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n                                         THE END\n"
