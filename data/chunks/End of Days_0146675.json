This character goes up against some of the most incredible\nobstacles imaginable---demons, burning buildings, zombies, quakes,\n\n. @tc.---and still manages to stand on his two feet. Touchingly, he\n\nseems to succumb to the power of Satan and momentarily become one\nof his minions, but this turns out to be only a trick to get\ncloser to the devil and destroy him---which he does in blazing\nglory. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\n And speaking of glory---the material also is not afraid to\nbring up questions of faith and virtue; the heroic security\nofficer is not afraid to finally ask for help from God, and it is\nin these final moments when he accepts God and renounces Satan\nthat the script has its most powerful emotional impact. The script\nwinds up succeeding on a couple of levels---the truly physical,\naction driven one, and the more sensitive, holy one. The script\nisnit entirely perfect, though. We wonder why the heroic officer,\nJericho, was targeted for destruction from the beginning----before\nhe even meets Satanis intended wife; and if this is the case, we\nwonder why Satan canit simply remove Jericho as an obstacle. As a\nresult of many similar questions the script seems, from time to\ntime, to be overly manipulated and contrived. But the action\nsequences seem to distract us from this, and the energy never\nsubsides. We also wonder why Satan canit just pick any woman he\nwants as a wife, not necessarily one who had to be ébaptized in\nblood{ 25 years earlier. Be that as it may, the script is dynamic\nand offers both action and food for religious thought.\n\n \n\nscrtpr: CONSIDER\nwRITER:; CONSIDER\n\f"
