Not\nreally. But I learned things. For\ninstance the largest diamond ever\nfound isn’t on Earth. It’s a burned\nout corpse of a star that’s 50\nlight years away in the\nConstellation Centaurus.\n\nTRACY (V.O.)\nShe’s on her feet.\n\nMOLLY (V.0O.)\nIt weighs 5-million trillion\ntrillion pounds which is 10-billion\ntrillion trillion carats.\n\fBlue Rev.",
