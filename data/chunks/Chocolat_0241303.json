This is, of course, a time of abstinence.\nHopefully also a time of reflection...\n\nSuddenly we hear WIND whistling through cracks in the windows. This slightly unnerves Pére Henri. He glances at:\nthe COMTE DE REYNAUD in the front pew.

Didi is distracted by an odd noise: the WHINE of a dog? He glances back at:\n\nGUILLAUME BLEROT, a shy sweet man of 70, who awkwardly smiles at Didi, The BLACK NOSE OF A SMALL SICKLY\nOLD DOG (CHARLY) - pokes out of Guillaume’s overcoat and WHINES, upset by the howling wind.
