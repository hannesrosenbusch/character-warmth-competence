TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT\n\nHuge crowds line the street, cheering on TWENTY EXOTIC\nVEHICLES waiting at the starting line.\n\nA MOTORBIKE straight from Road Warrior idles on the outside\nlane. Most of the other racers are in STOCK CARS, every\ndriver wearing the same helmet.\n\nThese are SIXERS, we’ll get back to them later.\n\nInterspersed with the Sixers are vehicles of every variety.\nAnd when I say every variety I mean that some of them are\ncars, and some of them are hover craft, and one of them is a\nBLIMP with a jet engine on it.\n\nTheir drivers are every size, shape and color, too. They are\ncalled GUNTERS. That too will be on the quiz.\n\nThe closer we get to the West Side of 7th Avenue, the more\nGunters there are. The second to last car is probably the\nmost bad-ass of the lot, a replica of DECKARD’S SPINNER from\nBLADE RUNNER.\n\nAECH, a handsome guy with the shoulders of a linebacker,\nchecks the OVERSIZED ENGINE strapped to the roof.\n\nPARZIVAL (0.S.)\nLemme guess - Mario Kart?\n\nHe turns to see PARZIVAL, standing beside his vintage\nDELOREAN, literally the car from BACK TO THE FUTURE. He’s\nnineteen years old, good-looking and fit.\n\nAECH\nNo. Designed it myself, actually.\nBad ass, right?\n\nPARZIVAL\nIt’s very Nintendo.\n\nTheir friendly rivalry requires busting on each other\nconstantly.\n\fAECH\nBetter than your p.o.s. level 4\nskin over a level 1 frame.\n\nPARZIVAL\nWeird that I’m still gonna outrace\nyou.",

SEVENTH AVENUE\n\nA GUNSHOT starts the race and the cars roar onto Seventh\nAvenue. Almost immediately, an Eighteen Wheeler runs a red\nlight and A THIRD OF THE CARS RAM RIGHT INTO IT.\n\nAnd they literally explode. Just like that. Boom, half the\ncars are incinerated. Nobody bats an eye or stops cheering.\n\nIN THE DELOREAN\n\nParzival stomps on the accelerator, chasing Aech's dust. Cars\nbump and jockey for position, but Parzival is careful to\navoid all of them, steering with tremendous precision.\n\nON 44TH STREET\n\nMetal walls suddenly pop up from the street, incongruously\nand with pretty much no logic to their placement. More of the\nSixer vehicles CRASH or SPIN OUT.\n\nAech has already passed them, and Parzival simply veers\nthrough the debris.\n\fPARZIVAL\nDumbasses.

CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS\n\nParzival hangs a RIGHT on 8th Avenue and puts the pedal to\nthe floor. On every block, a different obstacle emerges, and\neach time another driver is taken out. SINKHOLES open at 47th\nstreet, a MANIAC WITH A FLAMETHROWER sprays the intersection\nat 50th street, and at 54th street...\n\nA T-REX stomps out into the street and Parzival nimbly\nswerves between its legs, just as its massive jaws POP THE\nBLIMP.\n\nIt’s not your typical street race.\n\nEXT.",

Parzival settles in behind him. Up ahead, a few\nblocks away, is CENTRAL PARK.\n\nBut before that is 58th street. The whole block is in an\nexaggerated state of construction, like an obstacle course,\nleading up to A COLLAPSING CRANE.\n\nIt’s all a matter of timing and angle to get past the\ncollapsing crane, and Aech tries to take it AS SHARP AND AS\nFAST as he can.\n\nHe clears the falling CRANE, but he’s going too fast.
