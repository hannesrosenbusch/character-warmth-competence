A DARK PLACE, NIGHT\n\nA man on fire, his face and hair aflame. He stares at you,\naccusation in his eyes. You raise a hand to keep him away.\nThe hand bursts into flame. It is a torch, skin blistering.\nThe burning man screams. You are inside a tank, M1A1 Abrams.\nThe instruments glow green. Another man on fire scrambles\nfrom the hatch. The fire traces a lazy line across the\nbulkhead. It is headed to the ammunition stacks. The man\nscreams at you again. The fire leaps upon the magazine of\n20mm shells. It dances there a few seconds. The man is\nupon you - burning before your eyes. The scream is\nintelligible for the first time. \"I DON'T WANT TO DIE!\"\n\nINT. BAR, DAY\n\nThe flames become amber fluid in glass.\n\nCOLONEL NATHANIAL \"NAT\" SERLING, looks at the glass, at his\nwatch, finishes the drink, leaves.\n\nEXT. BAR, DAY\n\nSerling crosses the street pouring half a box of Tic-Tacs\ninto his mouth, eating them like candy.\n\nHe heads toward one of those anonymous buildings in Suitland\noutside Washington, D.C. Serling is in his 40's, born to the\nuniform, but there is something sad in his eyes, defeated in\nhis walk.\n\nHe enters the building.\n\nINT. HALLWAY, DAY\n\nThe sign on a door says \"U.S. Army - Awards and Decorations\nBranch.\" Serling enters.\n\nINT. COLONEL LEVINE'S OFFICE, DAY\n\nCOLONEL PHILLIP LEVINE, a little martinet, a bureaucratic\nHitler.\n\nSerling sits across from the desk from Levine.
