She flattens and folds them meticulously,\n     her glance darting angrily everywhere.  Top secret mission.\n\n     ...a natty little black man.  PARTRIDGE has spread a late supper on\n     a neat cloth atop a dryer.  Small cold fowl.  Brie, baguette,\n     olives.  Bottle of red.  An air of competence, of indomitable\n     upbeatness.  He ignores the spy-dressed-as-bag-lady as if she were\n     normal.  More curious about...\n\n     ...a hulking, rumpled figure scrutinizing Help Wanted ads as if\n     cramming for life's midterm exam.  Thoughtful.  Circles one,\n     slowly.  Set out on QUOYLE's dryer are one Snickers bar and four\n     empty snickers wrappers.  His version of cold supper.  He reaches\n     for the candy, but seeing it's the last one, he...\n\n     ...rises.  Goes to the candy machine.  Drops in his 65 cents, hits\n     the button.  The Snickers starts to fall, but gets caught in the\n     mechanism at the last moment.  Quoyle blinks dully.  One more\n     retelling of the story of his life.  He BANGS the machine half-\n     heartedly.  Nope.  Shakes it with his shambling strength.  Nada.\n     POUNDS the coin return button.  Hat trick.  He empties his pocket.\n     Studies the results.  Not enough.  And without so much as a sigh...\n\n     ...he ambles back to his dryer.",

At the coffin\n     now, he lifts her up to see.  Jack lies motionless, a wax figure of\n     himself.  Serene behind violet eyelids.\n\n                               BUNNY\n                     He looks like he's sleeping.\n\n     Dennis looks over.  His stolid, grim face releases a smile for his\n     friend.\n\n                               QUOYLE\n                     That's cos he's peaceful.  No\n                     worries, anymore.

For the mirror.\n\n     And across the room, Mrs. Buggit leans with trembling hands to fix\n     the Lodge pin to Jack's lapel.  Shaking as she is, the hand\n     lurches, the big pin goes PLUNGING, and...\n\n     ...a rattling COUGH.  Rolls across this room.  The world falls\n     silent.
