Maxwell, late fifties,\nrheumatic, testy and stubborn, is a man pleased with\nhimself and his achievements but not te the point of\nsmugness, He fancies himself decent and moral, a good\nand kind master to his slaves.\n\nAs they walk, Erownlee's eyes dart from slave to slave,\nappraising, evaluating. He stops from time to time to\nsqueeze a slave's muscle, poke or prod a belly or leg.\nMaxwell watches silently, with some disdain. Brownlee\nputs his hand on one black's shoulder, pushes him to\nhis knees, then wrenches the black's mouth open and\nexamines his teeth,\n\nEROWNLEE :\nYou craves to sell him, Mista\nMaxwell?\n\nMaxwell shakes his head, ‘The black smiles, relieved.\nErownlee moves on, stops before three young blacks,\nEMPEROR, BARBAROSA and CICERO, Brownlee examines\nEmperor, then Barbarosa, pulls and twists his fingers\nfor past fractures, inspects the skin on the boy's\nback, aE\nEBROWNLEE\nShuck down yer pants.\n\nThe black does so and Brownlee then spreads the black's\nbuttocks. : Lhe BO,\n\nYou wastin' time... he ain't\ngot hemmoroids,\n\nBrownlee feels the genital organ.\n\nBROWNLEE .\nYou alter some of ten?\n\n.",
