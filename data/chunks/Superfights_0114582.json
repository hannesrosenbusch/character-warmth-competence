WAREHOUSE - DAY\n\nAn old Chinese man, GRANDFATHER, going through a beautiful Tai Zhi\nQuan form. It is very peaceful and graceful. The form ends with a\npalm strike towards camera, blacking out the frame. (for possible\nINTERCUT use)\n\nINT. SUPERFIGHT ARENA - NIGHT\n\nSpotlights cut through the murky darkness while rock music PULSES.\nThe sound of the crowd, barely visible in the darkness, is a\nRUMBLE in the dark, not unlike the sound of an enraged animal.\n\nThey are yelling for blood!\n\nQUICK CUTS of other fighters in the ring, including Punks, Sumo\nwrestlers, Kickboxers, Shootfighters, and others. It's a\nspectacle, and we see bits and snippets of it all - the knockout\nblows, the colorful fighters, the incredible techniques, the\nbloodshed, the brutality. DARKCLOUD and NIGHT STALKER face off in\nthe ring. (ONE FIGHT)\n\nDarkcloud is slamming Night Stalker in the head over and over.\nWith the second blow, the man's mouthpiece goes flying into the\ncrowd. Soon, the blood starts to spray, but the man doesn't stop\nhitting.\n\nIn the front row, right next to the ring, is JACK CODY, an 18 year\nold dreamer. Drinking it all in, he is yelling his lungs out for\nthe fighters.\n\nA WOMAN standing next to Jack cringes at the brutality and covers\nher eyes.\n\nWOMAN\nHow can you watch this?\n\nJACK\nIt's great, isn't it? I love it!\n\nThe woman looks at Jack uncomprehendingly, then shakes her head\nand steps over him to get out, then walks up the stairs to the\nexit.\n\nThough the woman is very beautiful, Jack doesn't even watch her\ngo. He is too intent on the action in the ring.\n\nNow, one of the women fighters, ANGEL, dressed in a sexy outfit\nthat shows off her body, but also displays her finely defined\nmuscles, is fighting another SuperFighter. She is brutalizing the\nother fighter, yet both are covered in blood.",

She is brutalizing the\nother fighter, yet both are covered in blood. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\n\fThe towel has now been thrown in, but Angel STILL doesn't stop.\nAngel has her opponent by the throat and is motioning to the\ncrowd, thumbs up or thumbs down.\n\n\"NO MERCY\" cries the crowd, and Jack is yelling louder than\nanyone.\n\nJACK\nTake it to her, Angel! Yeah!\n\nAngel spins and hook kicks her opponent in the head, then spins\nthe other way and side kicks her into the ropes. The other fighter\nFLIES off the ropes and lands face down in the center of the ring.\n\nIt's brutal and barbaric.\nAnd Jack loves every minute of it.\n\nA spotlight lights up the stage, and two bizarre FIGHTERS stand in\nthe middle, facing each other.\n\nANNOUNCER\nIn the red corner, Budokai!\n\nBUDOKAI is dressed in a gold lame uniform, his belt black. His\nface is painted like a kabuki actor, a mixture of black and white\nand gold, and his outfit emphasizes his massive muscles.\n\nANNOUNCER (0.S.)\nAnd in the blue corner, the Enforcer!\n\nTHE ENFORCER, dressed like a street punk, with chains and leather,\nspikes and chrome, comes into the ring. He is the bad guy here,\nand everyone knows it. He raises his muscled arms over his head\nand smiles at the crowd, then brings them down into a fighting\nstance.\n\nANNOUNCER (0.S.)\nSuperFight!\n\nThe two fighters face off in fighting positions. The rock music\nincreases its BEAT, and the fighters rush each other, the ring\n\nechoing with the fury of their techniques. Budokai is a martial\nartist, while the Enforcer is a thug. But a well trained thug,\n\nnonetheless.\n\nUsing a mixture of professional wrestling, boxing and street\nfighting, the Enforcer HAMMERS Budokai in a beautifully\nchoreographed fight.\n\nBudokai beaten, the Enforcer stands before the crowd, seemingly\nasking them for a decision.\n\nThe crowd ROARS.\n\nANNOUNCER\nWhat'll it be? Mercy?\n\nThe crowd YELLS out \"NO MERCY!\" Everyone except Jack that is, who\nlikes Budokai, after all.\n\fThe Enforcer listens to what they want, then smiles and launches a\nhuge roundhouse right.",

They stand up\ntogether, both a little stunned. The Enforcer is now out of the\nring and coming towards Budokai, and Jack is caught in the middle.\n\nJack, in the heat of the moment, turns to face off with the\nEnforcer! He throws a couple of kicks and punches, which have no\neffect - except to further enrage the Enforcer.\n\nThe Enforcer goes crazy and attacks Jack. Budokai grabs Jack and\nthrows him up into the sky, and then knocks the Enforcer out, and\nJack lands on top of the Enforcer (like a pin in wrestling),\ncounting him out.\n\nThe ref comes out of the ring and holds up Budokai's hand, and\nBudokai reaches down and pulls Jack up to a standing position,\nholding his hand up.\n\nBUDOKAT\nNO MERCY! EVER!\n\nBudokai looks at Jack, who is beaming with pride, as the crowd\ngoes crazy. Budokai winks at Jack.\n\nBUDOKAIL\nThanks, man.

A JOGGER runs by in front, getting a workout\nin before a busy day starts.\n\nINT. LOADING DOCK - SAME DAY\n\nIn the loading dock, we MOVE THROUGH the assembled goods, boxes\nand various things. In the b.g. can be heard the sound of labored\nbreathing, and solid THUNKS and THWOCKS .\n\nWe MOVE through a door that is ajar, into an area of the warehouse\nseparate from the storage area. On the walls are posters from\n\"SuperFights\", martial arts training posters, pictures of Bruce\nLee, Chuck Norris, Jean Claude Van Damme (from \"No Retreat No\nSurrender\"), movie posters, professional wrestlers, etc.\n\nPictures of a fighter named MIKE ROCCO are featured prominently.\nRocco, in the pictures, is wearing a special necklace (Open\nHand?).",

Rocco, in the pictures, is wearing a special necklace (Open\nHand?). \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\n There is a magazine with his picture on it, and the legend\nreads \"Rocco: Where is he now?\" There is also a picture of Rocco\nwith his arm around a young fighter - a younger Jack.\n\fWe see a SHADOW of what looks like two people fighting over the\npicture of Rocco.\n\nThe sounds of violent training are closer, more immediate.\n\nA counter is piled high with training books, and a TV/VCR\ncombination sits next to them, a pile of martial arts training\nvideos sitting on top. A tape is in the machine, and it is paused\non one particular instructor, Mike Rocco, demonstrating a\ntechnique.\n\nStanding next to the counter are mannequins in various positions,\nall dressed in sporting goods equipment - at first they look like\nreal fighters. We see Jack moving among them, doing flips (with\nthe aid of an unseen trampoline).\n\nSome of the mannequins are wearing protective equipment, others\nswimsuits, still others in martial arts uniforms.\n\nSmoothly, we TURN AROUND to see Jack, in a muscle shirt and\nworkout pants, working on a mannequin, and we realize that they\nare just mannequins, not real people. He is very athletic, and has\nobviously been training for some time. He is not a master, but he\nis strong and effective, with a great\n\ndeal of raw talent. When he hits and kicks the heavy bag, hanging\nin the middle of the room, it SHAKES the entire room.\n\nJack is wearing the special necklace that Rocco had on in the\npictures.\n\nAfter one particularly grueling combination, Jack stops, drinks\nfrom a sport bottle nearby. He then grabs the TV remote and pushes\na button.\n\nANGLE ON TV\n\nThe tape continues, the instructor (Mike Rocco) moving on to\nanother combination.\n\nJack watches it carefully, then rewinds it, and plays it again. He\nthen presses \"pause\" and puts the remote back. He starts hitting\nthe heavy bag again, mimicking the combination the instructor\nshowed on the tape.\n\nAs he is working this combination, an alarm on his watch goes off\nand Jack stops.

One mannequin is still standing.\n\nJACK\nNo mercy.\n\nHe jumps off the trampoline (we see it now) and drives a spinning\nwheel kick at the lone mannequin and hits it, but sends himself\nsprawling at the same time.\n\nThe fantasy is disrupted by reality. Jack smiles and puts his head\nin his hands, resting.\n\nFRANKIE\nCody? That you?\n\nJack doesn't answer right away.\n\nFRANKIE (0.S.)\nYo, Jean Claude Van Dunce? You there?\n\nJACK\nYeah, Frankie.

JACK HOUSE - EVENING\n\nEstablishing shot of a run down tract house in a \"poor white\ntrash\" suburb of the city. The house is much cleaner than the\nothers in the area.
