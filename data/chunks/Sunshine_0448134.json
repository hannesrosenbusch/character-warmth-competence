Now tens of millions of miles distant from the star,\nwhere the sound of fission and countless rolling nuclear\ndetonations are silenced by the vacuum...\n\nEXT. ICARUS II\n+++ a SPACESHIP is heading towards the sun.\n\nThe ship is curved and organic in its design, with bulky\nflanks that look as if they can detach from the rest of the\nvessel.\n\nMost striking of all, the ship is covered in mirrored panels,\nsimilar to fish scales.\n\nThe mirrored panels cover the entire surface of the ship,\nexcept for the window portals, and a geodesic dome situated\ntowards the back. These portals and the dome are constructed\nwith a thick half-mirrored glass.\n\nThe distances involved are so huge between the ship and the\nsun that it hardly seems to be moving.\n\fBut as we get closer, and we see space dust and particles\nflash past or colliding with the huli, detonating and burning\nunder the impact and friction, we realise that in fact the\nship is travelling at an extraordinarily fast speed.\n\nOn the SPACESHIP’S side is its name: ICARUS II.\n\nIr REAT I! ROOM\n\nIn the RECREATION ROOM of the ICARUS II, two men sit either\nside of a small table, arms folded, their faces a picture of\ndeep thought.\n\nThe first, and older, of these two men is CAPTAIN ASHER. The\nICARUS II is under his command. He’s a career astronaut.\nImplacable, calm, experienced.\n\nThe younger of the two men is CAPA. CAPA is a career\nphysicist. In contrast to ASHER, CAPA is thin, young, nervy,\nand looks unkempt.",
