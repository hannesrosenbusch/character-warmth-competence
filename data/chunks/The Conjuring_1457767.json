At the\nreins is JUDSON SHERMAN, early twenties. A ranch hand\naround his same age rides next to him. By the way\nthey’re dressed, and the style of the wagon, we’re\nsomewhere in the late 1800's.\n\nJudson’s leading the team toward a two-story y English\nstyled farm house with a covered porch in the distance.\nMaple and Hickory trees tower around it. Dull light\nstabs out from several windows. Smoke plumes from the\nfireplace. A large barn stands fifty yards away.\n\npightening cracks across a violent, dark sky, as_sunrise\nis’just s arting to break through the horizon. Judson\npulls out a gold pocket watch. Reads: 5:15.\n\nAs he puts his watch away, he hears something. Cocks his\nhead -- there it is again -- A BABY WAILING -- but this\nisn’t a “I’m hungry or tired cry”, this is swelling\neruptions of excruciating pain.\n\nJudson cracks the reins hard -- the horses rear, then\nbolt like they're shot out of a cannon, kicking up mud as\nthey thunder faster to the house.\n\nThe wails are almost more than Judson can take as he\ndrives the team right to the front door, and reins back\nhard, hopping off the wagon before it comes to a halt,\nthen --\n\n-- just as he gets to the front porch -- the wailing\nSTOPS.
