It sits there quietly; The\nonly movement appears to come from behind a window. We hear a delivery truck\npull up. Its sliding door opens and closes. A MAILMAN walks into shot carrying a\npackage and searches for the doorbell. He finds it amongst some ivy and rings.\nWINFRIED, a man in his mid-60s with wavy gray hair, an unkempt beard and a pair\nof colorful reading glasses, opens the door.\n\nMAILMAN\nGood morning. Package.\n\nThe mailman starts typing something on a modern electronic signature device.\n\nWINFRIED\nWait a moment... No idea what my brother’s been\nordering again.\n\nWinfried steps a couple of meters into the house and calls to someone. The mailman\nwaits professionally.\n\nWINERIED (0.S.) (CONT’D)\nToni?! Did you order something?\n\nHe returns to the mailman.\n\nWINFRIED (CONT'D)\n\n(quietly)\nMy brother just got released from prison. He\n\ndoes whatever he wants.\n\nMAILMAN\nOh dear.\n\nWINFRIED\nHe was locked up for mail bombs. Yesterday, he\nate a whole can of dog food. OK, just a moment,\nplease.\n\nWinfried disappears again, leaving the mailman standing there. He diligently carries\non holding the package.\n\nWINERIED (0.S.) (CONT’D)\n(suddenly shouting)\nToni, get your ass out of the hammock right now!\n\nTONI(0.S.)\nI’m still having breakfast.\n\fWINERIED (0.S.)\nKeep this up and I’ll throw you out. Did you\norder something from Orion again?\n\nTONI(0.S.)\nNo, I didn’t. Don’t be so mean to me.\n\nAman appears. Apart from a few distinctive teeth, he looks uncannily similar to\nWinfried. He’s wearing a black bathrobe and dark sunglasses. He voice has changed\nand he mumbles when he speaks. The mailman quickly hands him the package.\n\nTONI (CONT'D)\nWhat my brother said about me isn’t true. I’ve\nnever ordered any erotic products.\n\nThe mailman holds the device out so Toni can sign it.",

A pair of handcuffs dangles from his wrist and the\nmailman notices them with bemusement. He briefly puts his ear to the package.\n\nTONI (CONT'D)\nThanks. Now I’m really looking forward to\ndefusing it.\n\nIn the background, by the garden fence, LUKAS appears: He’s a pale teenager (16)\nwith tight-fitting black jeans and drooping shoulders. Winfried quickly takes off his\nsunglasses and removes a set of false teeth from his mouth and sticks them in his\npocket. He can’t help but laugh.\n\nWINFRIED\nHey, Lukas...\n\nWinfried looks at the mailman, who also laughs with bewilderment. It’s not clear\nwhether Winfried’s act might have convinced him for a moment, after all. Lukas still\nstands some distance away, unsure whether he’s allowed to come closer.\n\nWINFRIED (CONT’D)\n(to mailman)\nNo offense meant. They were both me. It was\nobvious, right?\n\nWinfried fishes out a five-euro bill and gives the mailman a quick pat on the\nshoulder. An electronic beeping sound emanates from Winfried’s body.\n\fWINFRIED (CONT'D)\nDon’t worry. That’s just my blood pressure\nmonitor.\n\nWinfried finally takes the package from the mailman.\n\nWINFRIED (CONT'D)\nYou're the bravest one yet.\n(to Lukas)\nI'll be right there...\n\nThe mailman leaves and Winfried also disappears.\n\nINT. - WINFRIED’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - GARDEN - DAY\n\nIn the living room, Winfried hastily takes off his bathrobe. Several plastic objects\nand cables are attached to his body. They look like an explosive belt. He buttons his\nshirt and puts down the package. The device on his body is still beeping. An old dog\n(WILLI) hauls himself up off the floor and lies down again at a safe distance. The\ndog’s breathing is labored and fluid rattles in his lungs.\n\nWINFRIED\nCome in...\n\nLukas enters the living room.

I bought it\njust for you.\n\nLukas freezes for a moment.\n\nWINFRIED (CONT'D)\nJust kidding. But you have to tell your mother.\nI’m not doing it.\n\nLukas nods. The dog can be heard wheezing in the garden.\n\nWINFRIED (CONT'D)\nThat's just the dog.\n\nWinfried walks into the garden to fetch his beer. He bends down to Willi again. He\nquickly takes a plate of sausage from the table and places it front of the dog. Willi\nturns his head away. Winfried grabs his beer and walks back to Lukas.\n\nWINFRIED (CONT’D)\nDo you drink beer already?\n\nLUKAS\nAh, yeah, sure.\n\nWINFRIED\nMy internet’s acting up.

Face paints lie on the table. On the computer screen we see pictures of\npeople painted like the death.\n\nLUKAS\nI'd put some blood there, too.\n\nWINFRIED\nOK.\n\fWinfried looks into a small hand mirror and applies a little more blood to the corner\nof his mouth.\n\nLUKAS\nThat looks cool.

He closes the front door and follows Lukas\ndown the walkway. In the distance, an elderly couple walks towards Winfried and\nlooks at him with bemusement.\n\nEXT. - ANNEGRET’S HOUSE - GARDEN - TERRACE - DAY\n\nWinfried walks through a landscaped garden. He slowly pulls Willi up some steps\nwhile also lugging the basket and shopping bags. Inside the house, ANNEGRET, a\nvery old woman, sits in her living room in front of the TV. Winfried gives a warning\nknock on the glass veranda doors and holds a “Frau im Spiegel - Woman in the\nMirror” magazine in front of his face. Its cover depicts German TV host Thomas\nGottschalk. Winfried slowly lowers the magazine. Annegret, his mother, is not at all\nshocked to see his painted face.

She begins imperiously\nexamining the groceries and checking them against her shopping list. It takes her a\nlong time to do anything, but she doesn’t want help. We hear the sound of a radio\ncoming from the bedroom.\n\nWINFRIED (CONT’D)\nIs Mrs. Radica still here?\n\fAnnegret doesn’t answer.

Winfried peels himself out of the corner. He walks into a back\nroom, past the bathroom which MRS. RADICA, a domestic maid of Eastern European\nappearance, is cleaning.\n\nWINFRIED (CONT'D)\nDon't be frightened...\n\nMRS. RADICA\nOh, my...\n\nMrs. Radica laughs. Winfried gives her a friendly handshake. Annegret follows him\nwith her walking frame so she can keep an eye on what he’s doing.

They’re standing outside a door leading to the auditorium.\nThe children all have their faces painted like Death and they’re making an effort to\nstand quietly.

The students prematurely push forward\ninto a darkened backstage area. A few of them are carrying instruments. They\ncollide with the art club as it leaves the stage with a huge, long artwork that requires\nseveral students to carry it. A crush ensues. One of the “young Deaths” gets pushed\nover and fights back.\n\nWINFRIED (CONT’D)\nSlowly, slowly... Arne, get up.\n\nFrom outside, we hear as the music club’s performance is announced.\n\nWINFRIED (CONT’D)\nOK guys, now focus. Everyone’s sad...\n\nThe students let their shoulders droop and amble very sadly onto the stage.\nWinfried checks that every last student is there. A few members of the audience\nburst out laughing. Winfried is the last person to take to the stage. He gives a\ncommand and the students make a voodoo-like racket, then chant...\n\nSTUDENTS\n(chanting in unison)\nWe're dead sad that you're leaving, Mr.\nDudinger!\n\nIn the packed auditorium, people laugh bemusedly. A MANN in the front row, clearly\nthe person being bid farewell, isn’t sure how to take it. Winfried gives another\ncommand and starts playing a tune on his guitar.

He\nputs on his hat and gets out of the car.\n\nEXT./INT. - RENATE’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nWinfried fishes a bottle of red wine from a canvas grocery bag. With his colorful\nreading glasses hanging around his neck, he’s now only a half-Death. At the front\ndoor, he hitches up his pants and takes a breath. He plucks up the courage to ring\nthe bell. RENATE (60) opens the door.\n\nRENAT\nMy God... what's this?\n\nm\n\nWINFRIED\nSorry. I have an upset stomach.\n\nShe lets him in.

Ines looks straight at him, and, for a\nmoment, she seems to freeze. But then she walks on and continues her conversation\nwith a colleague, who turns around to face her. Winfried watches her, and the group\ndisappears into an elevator beyond a staff-only barrier. Winfried walks onwards,\nout of the building. Outside, he removes the false teeth and sunglasses. For a\nmoment he stands there, perplexed, unsure whether Ines saw him or not.\n\fEXT. - IN FRONT OF BUCHAREST OFFICE BUILDING - DAY\n\nWinfried walks outside, onto the street.

Ines is\nalso uncertain. The Kukeri’s dark fur creates a sinister impression. The costume is\nstriking. Nothing about it suggests that there’s a person inside. Anca tries to use her\nhandbag to cover herself a little. The doorbell rings again. Anca hides behind a\ncolumn. Ines has no choice but to walk to the door again and open it.

Totally naked? Or what's this about?\n\nInes nods vaguely. As if carrying out a dare, Gerald puts his clothes to one side. For a\nmoment he just stands there, naked.
