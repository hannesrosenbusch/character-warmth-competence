BAR - NIGHT 1\n\nCASSIDY sits at the bar with a glass of beer, packet of\nCamels in front of him beside his change, one lit in his\nhand. Bar noises behind him - jukebox music, conversation.\nOccasional glimpse of people passing by behind him. Smoky\natmosphere. We stay on him as he knocks back the beer, sets\ndown the empty glass, smiles wryly.\n\nCASSIDY\nPiss. And not enough of it.\n\nThe BARMAN picks up the glass. Cassidy draws on his\ncigarette, sits back. He’ll now tell us the story as if we\nwere sitting at the bar beside him, so he won't always be\nlooking right at us.\n\nCASSIDY\nSo where was I? Oh aye, the\nPreacher. Well, before I get stuck\ninto this you'd better get it\nstraight that this is no ordinary\nstory.

Or maybe\nbad guys kill helpless innocents,\nhead bad guy with English accent\nprepares to take over the world,\nArnie Schwarzennegger kills everybody\nin sight, girl shows us her tits,\neverything blows up, the end...\n\nThe barman sets down a fresh beer. Cassidy is pleased.\n\nCASSIDY\nBut this one's different. Just about\nas different as you can fucking get,\nto tell you the truth. Jesus, I was\nsmack in the middle of it, and even ft\ndon't believe half the fucking things\nthat went on. There was angels.\nDemons. Rednecks. Gunslingers from\nbeyond the grave. Fucking vampires,\nwould you believe. There was a boy\nwith a face that looked like your\narsehole, and a woman who was braver\nthan any man I ever met, and a man\nwho stood tall in front of Heaven\nitself and faced down the power of\nGod.\n\nHe sips his beer, looks thoughtful, smiles a bit.",

Further on, a quick look down an alley reveals\nmovement, the sound of breaking glass. A sheriff's dept.\ncruiser passes us, going in the opposite direction. Moving\nacross the town square we see another DRUNK passed out on a\nbench, with a vile-looking DOG raping his unconscious leg.\n\nWe move slowly towards the church, a simple wooden building\njust outside town, on the opposite side to where we came in.\nA light is on within, and as we get closer we hear raised\nvoices, a Man's and a woman's.\n\n3 INT.
