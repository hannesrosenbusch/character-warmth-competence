Lesser-known actors, agents and\nexecutives of all ages.\n\nInto this bar comes Ben.\n\nBen is in his thirties. He is wearing an Armani suit that\n\ncould use a visit to the dry-cleaner's. He hasn't shaved in\n\nthe last twenty-four hours (but neither has any of the actors\n\nin the bar). He is a good-looking man but is clearly in\n\ntrouble of some kind. Although still in control of his\n\nfaculties, it becomes clear in the following scene that he\n\nis much the worse for wear with drink. He looks around the\nroom until he sees someone he recognizes and then walks over\nto a table where two couples are seated. The men are young\nexecs, the girls, both blonde and busty, have very white\nteeth and smile all of the time. The camera follows Ben over\nto the table. One of the execs looks up as Ben gets close.\n\nHe recognizes him but delays his recognition until the last\nmoment in the hope that Ben is not looking at him.\n\nScript provided for educational purposes.
