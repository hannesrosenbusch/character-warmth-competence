So she was already in the\n\n                    hot seat with the CIA, and so now\n\n                    she's all about the money. Plus\n\n                    it's come out that she was\n\n                    considered kind of a mediocre agent\n\n                    at best.\n\n          \n\n          INT. LIVING ROOM.
