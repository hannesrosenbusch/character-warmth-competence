  "1": "Please Read This Bit Before Reading The Screenplay:\n\n\n\n  This is the official 'Unoffical' Monty Python And The Holy Grail screenplay.\nThis file contains the script as it was on March 20 1974, before filming took\nplace.  There are many minor differences from what appears here and what\nended up on the screen.  <I.E. A paraphrased word or two or another\ncharacter used a line... But generally in minor lines like 'LOOK!'>\nThis file also contains cut scenes and lines from the film.\n\n\n  I tried to preserve as much of the screenplay as possible but it isn't\neasy to cross out a section and pencil in new dialogue, in ASCII.\nAny Scene or dialogue that was crossed out begins with a \"|\" before it.\nAnything Penciled in has a \"+\", I also put cut information before penciled in.\n\n\n  What is interesting about a screenplay is to see what they threw out and\nwhat \"Catch Phrases\" were literally penciled in.  The reason I keyed in\nthis file was caused by me downloading current transcript going\naround internet.  It was an amazing job... I wouldn't want to have attempted\nwhat he did... But it wasn't in a good script format and I didn't like how\ndirection was written in. Since I HAD the real screenplay I thought...\nWhat the hell!\n\n\n  After This I plan to key in \"Monty Python's Second Film\" it is the 1st draft\nof the Holy Grail. It is the script that eventually got canabalized into\nsketches for the 4th season of Python.  It Is sill quite different and well\nworth a read. is anybody interested in it?????\n\n\n  Oh yes... I will STRESS this fact once more... THIS IS A SCREENPLAY... So\ndon't yell at me if a line is paraphrased in the film... This is what was\nwritten before filming took place and it is still quite accurate.\n\n\nEnough of this...\n\n\n-Grue (09-Aug-92)\n\n\nP.S.
