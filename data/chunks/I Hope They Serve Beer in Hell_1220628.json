He peels off his shit-heavy socks and flings them in\nthe direction of the boxers. One sticks to the mirror.\n\nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS 95\n\nNaked and covered in speckles of his own poop, Tucker slinks\nout into the lobby.\n\nTUCKER\nWho else on this earth could be\nhaving a worse night than me?\n\nLaid out before him is a trail of his own feces. It starts\nwide at his feet and gets smaller until it apexes at the\nclunky white shoes of the small Mexican janitor.\n\nTUCKER (CONT'D)\nSorry. I mean, uh, lo siento.\n\nTucker walks defeated toward the elevators. The Lady Janitor\nis sobbing hysterically.\n\nINT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 96\n\nWaiting for the elevator, Tucker stares at himself in the\nreflective doors, looking into his own eyes and\nface...disappointed. He exhales deeply as the elevator\narrives with a ding and the doors open.\n\nThrough the glass of the elevator as it ascends, Tucker sees\nwhy the janitor was crying hysterically.\n\f97\n\n98\n\n99\n\n96.\n\nThere’s shit everywhere: on the couches, the walls, the\nplants, everywhere.\n\nTUCKER\nGod, I hope they serve beer in\nhell.\nEXT./INT. WEDDING CHAPEL - NEXT DAY 97 *\n\nJeff and Kristy have their backs to us. The last groomsman is\nnot dressed the same as the rest, because he took Tucker's\nplace at the 11th hour. They finish the ceremony and turn\ndown the aisle. Jeff's black eyes and swollen brows are\nsmeared in DermaBlend. Sweating from nerves, Jeff's face\nlooks like someone pissed on a chalk painting.\n\nINT. TUCKER'S HOTEL ROOM *\n\nTucker looks a little bleary-eyed but he’s freshly showered *\n\nand hastily yanking on his tuxedo. The room service menu is *\n\nopen on the bed and he’s on the room phone. *\n\nTUCKER *\n\nYeah. Yeah. I know.",

RECEPTION HALL - LATER 98\n\nThe banquet hall is beautiful. Large bay windows frame the\nelegant wedding reception inside. It’s an idyllic scene\nbroken only by workers setting things up on the lawn.\n\nINT. RECEPTION HALL - LATER 99\n\nThe maid of honor is finishing her speech. Tucker slides in\nquietly and settles against the bar. He whispers something to\nthe bartender, who nods, and sneaks him some money.\n\nMAID OF HONOR\nAnd after that, I knew she’d met a\nkeeper. And I was right. I love you\nKristy!\n\nEveryone toasts and politely claps. The BEST MAN, Jeff's *\nbrother, picks up the mic. He is sweating and nervous.\n\nANGLE ON Tucker at the bar. He motions to the bartender for a *\nbeer. *\n\f97.\n\nWEDDING BARTENDER\nFour bucks.\n\nTUCKER\nWhat?!\n\nBEST MAN (0.S.)\nHey, I am Jeff’s older brother.\n\nWEDDING BARTENDER\nCash bar.\n\nTUCKER\nWho has a cash bar at a wedding?\n\nTucker reluctantly pays as we ANGLE BACK on the best man.\n\nBEST MAN\nI’ve known him his whole life, and\nboy are my arms tired.\n\nNo response. ANGLE ON Aaron, sitting at a table with Lara.\n\nAARON\nBet that joke killed on his blog.\n\nANGLE on Best Man.\n\nBEST MAN\nUh, when Jeff told me he’d met the\ngirl he wanted to marry, I couldn't\nbelieve it. Only a few short years\nago, he was throwing rocks at\ngirls, and now, he is putting one\non...her finger.\n\nANGLE on Tucker, standing at the back of the room.\n\nBEST MAN (CONT’D)\nI have known Kristy for a few years\nnow, and I couldn’t have asked for\na better sister-in-law.

Jeff is my best\nfriend. Or at least was, until last\nweek when I took advantage of his\nkindness and loyalty. I forced him\ninto lying to Kristy, dragged him\ntwo hours away, got him abusively\ndrunk, and then ditched him to\nsleep with a midget stripper. I am\nthe reason that, on the most\nimportant day of his life, Jeff's\nface looks like a melted Barbie\ndoll's.\n\nKristy’s mother is nearly apoplectic. Jeff, holding back his\nbuilding fury, scoots his chair out to get up, but Kristy\nputs her hand on his leg to stop him and keep him seated.\n\nTUCKER (CONT'D)\nThe worst part is that I didn't\nknow I was doing anything wrong. I\nwas just doing what I’ve always\ndone; which is pretty much whatever\nthe hell I want. And to be honest,\nit's worked out pretty well for me\nup to about 24 hours ago. When my\nselfishness finally caught up with\nme and cost me Jeff’s friendship,\nand my invitation to his wedding.\n\nAaron and Lara look at each other.\n\nTUCKER (CONT'D)\nStill, I shrugged it off and went\nout anyway. I won't bore you with\nthe particulars but the long and\nshort of it is, I got drunk and\nended the night sprinting across\nthe hotel lobby, uncontrollably\nshitting my pants.\n\nGasps across the audience.\n\nTUCKER (CONT'D)\nNo really, I crapped all over the\nlobby. And following my selfish\npattern, I left the mess and went\nback to my room like nothing\nhappened.\n\nMore gasps.\n\n+ eH\n\n+ eH\n\f99.\n\nTUCKER (CONT'D)\nThe only thing that prevented me\nfrom passing out in a pile of my\nown puke was all the knocking at my\ndoor.\n\n100 INT.

When I came to\nyour hotel room last night to say\nsorry, I honestly didn't understand\nwhat I was apologizing for. But\nover the past 24 hours, it's hit me\nlike, well, like ten pounds of\nslippery shit. I've been a horrible\nfriend. And even though I probably\ndon't deserve to have either of you\nin my life, I had to come here to\ntell you that and to ask you for\nyour forgiveness.\n\n*\n\f102\n\n100.\n\nANGLE on Jeff and Kristy, who look at each other.\n\nTUCKER (CONT'D)\nI know this will probably scare the\ncrap out of most of you, but I hope\nto have kids someday. I am sure I\nwill only have daughters, and they\nwill all be vicious sluts who sleep\nwith assholes just like me and then\nthrow it in my face. But such is\nkarma. If one is a boy, though, I\nwill consider myself a huge success\nas a father if he grows up to be\nhalf the man that Jeff Smith is\nright now.\n\nANGLE ON the room. Expressions have softened, the room is\nquiet, some still unsure what to think. ANGLE ON Aaron and\nLara.\n\nLARA\n\n(crying)\nThat’s so sweet.\n\nAaron rolls his eyes.
