Few passers-by.\n\nA single woman in her mid-40s (JULIETTE) sits at a table. Sips\ncoffee. Gazes around her as if discovering something new - she\noften has an expression of eager surprise, as if seeing things,\npeople, places for the first time ever.\n\nShe seems uncomfortable in the clothes she is wearing. At her feet\nis an old-fashioned suitcase.\n\nA younger woman (LEA, early 30s) appears behind Juliette. Less than\na meter away.\n\nJuliette hasn’t noticed her. Clearly deeply moved, Léa quietly\nobserves her for a few seconds.\n\nThen, sensing a presence, Juliette looks round.\n\nLéa leans forward and hugs her tight before Juliette has time to\nreact. Juliette is slightly taken aback.\n\nShe doesn’t return the hug at first. Then awkwardly puts her arms\nround Léa.\n2. INT. LEA’S CAR - DAY\nLéa is driving.\nNext to her, Juliette tugs at the sleeves of her sweater.\n\nLEA\nIs it too big?\nJULIETTE\nNo.\nLEA\n\nI like that sweater. The skirt, too. I\noften wear them.\n\nJuliette doesn’t reply.\n\nLEA\nI thought it would be better to wait\nuntil you arrived to go shopping for\nclothes.\n\nLéa glances at Juliette.\n\nBeat.\n\nThere’s something out of place about Juliette. She even sits oddly\nin the car seat, as if unused to it.\n\nLEA\nDid you have a good trip?\n\nJULIETTE\n\fI don’t like flying.\nLéa glances at her again.\n\nJULIETTE\nHave you lived here long?\n\nLEA\nTen years. I finished my PhD here, met\nLuc, got married, was offered the\njob... The usual stuff.\nJuliette is silent.\n\nThe CAMERA lingers on her face.\n\n3. INT.

The kitchen’s\nover there with the living room\nopposite, our home offices and a\nlibrary at the far end. Upstairs,\nthere’s just bedrooms. Do you want to\nsee yours?\n\nJuliette replies by a slight nod and the flicker of a smile.\nLéa leads the way up the stairs.\n\nOn the first landing, she shows Juliette into a room.\n\nLEA\nWill it be okay?\n\nJULIETTE\nFine.\n\nLEA\nThat little door leads to your private\nbathroom.\n(glances at her watch)\nYikes, I have to pick up the girls!\nI’1l be back in half an hour.

INT. LEA’S HOUSE - DAY\nMONTAGE of Juliette’s tour of the house.\nIn the living room, she strokes a cat dozing on a chair.\n\nIn a study, she runs her hand over the back of a couch. Gazes at\nframed photos.\n\nIn the kitchen, she pours herself a glass of water. Drinks slowly,\nleaning back against the fridge.\n\nUpstairs, Juliette opens a door. A child’s bedroom. She closes the\ndoor hurriedly.\n\nShe opens another door. A library full of books. With a single bed\nand two chairs. Sitting in one of the chairs, an elderly man is\nreading.\n\nJULIETTE\nI’m sorry, I... I didn’t think anyone\nwas home.\n\nThe old man looks up without a word and smiles at her.\n\nJULIETTE\nI...

She looks 8-9 years old. Both girls are Asian.\n\nLEA\nLili, open the gate, will you? You\nknow it’s hard when I’m carrying\nEmelia.\n\nThey go through the gate into the small front garden.\nLILI\n\nIs Auntie Juliette going to stay with\nus forever?\n\fLEA\nNo, sweetheart, just some time. Be\nnice to her, okay? She’s tired. Don’t\npester her.\n\nThey enter the house.\n\nLEA\nJuliette? It’s us!\n\nJuliette comes down the stairs. The kids gaze up at her.\nAs soon as she reaches the bottom step, Lili rushes over.\n\nLILI\nHello, Auntie!\n\nJuliette seems quite distant, or maybe just ill at ease.\n\nLili stands on tiptoes to give her a kiss.\nJuliette hesitates fractionally before giving her a kiss back.\n\nEmelia gurgles the word “Auntie” repeatedly.\n\nLEA\nThese are my two princesses, Clélis -\nbut everybody calls her Little Lili -\nand little miss Emelia.
