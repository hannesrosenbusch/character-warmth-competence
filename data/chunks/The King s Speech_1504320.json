The shield is surmounted by a crown.\n\n\n\n    This emblem is on a cuff-link fastened on a starched white\n\n    shirt.\n\n\n\n    Trousers, pressed to a knife-edge, are held for stockinged feet\n\n    and gartered legs to be inserted.\n\n\n\n    Mirror-polished boots are laced tight.\n\n\n\n    Jacket, held ready.

It is the principle\n\n                  which permits a State, in the selfish\n\n                  pursuit of power, to disregard its treaties\n\n                  and its solemn pledges; which sanctions the\n\n                  use of force, or threat of force, against\n\n                  the sovereignty and independence of other\n\n                  States.
