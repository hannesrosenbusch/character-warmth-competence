I decided not to tell you\nthen. After all, eleven was too\nyoung for such burdens. The same\nwent for twelve. But I was running\nout of excuses by thirteen and\nfourteen. Do you see the flaw in my\nplan yet?\n\nHarry shakes his head.\n\f194.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\n\nI cared about you too much.

That was my greatest mistake.\nIt was exactly what Voldemort\nexpects from us fools who love.\n\n(pause)\nBut I could not bear to tell you.

But\nunfortunately, I must.\n\nHARRY\nI don’t understand, Professor.\n\nDumbledore sighs again.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\n\nThe reason Voldemort tried to kill\nyou is because of a prophesy made\njust before your birth. By\nattempting to kill you, he believed\nhe was fulfilling the terms of the\nprophesy. Voldemort’s mistake was\nthat he had not heard the entire\nprophesy.\n\n(pause)\nThat is the weapon we have been\nguarding, and which he has been so\ndesperately seeking: the knowledge\nof how to destroy you.\n\nHarry sighs this time.
