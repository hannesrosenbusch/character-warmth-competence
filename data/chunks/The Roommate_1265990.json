No answer. Knocks again.\n\n\n\n          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT\n\n\n\n          Rebecca sits back into Sara's chair, staring at the door,\n\n          ignoring the knocks. Almost catatonic.\n\n          Her right hand slowly drags a utility knife over the armrest,\n\n          shredding it to pieces.\n\n\n\n          INT.

DORM - SHOWER - NIGHT\n\n\n\n          Rebecca lets the water soak her. Eyes open. She runs her\n\n          fingers through her now long dark brown hair.

She then digs into her bag and pulls out a long\n\n          pair of shears. Her \"Emily\" tattoo is starting to heal. She\n\n          gently traces the letters with the sharp tips of the shears,\n\n          still looking at it in the mirror.\n\n          She lifts the shears and starts cutting her hair shorter.\n\n          Just above her shoulders.\n\n\n\n          INT.

Holds it in front of herself as she stands in\n\n          front of the mirror. Nice -- but something's missing.\n\n          Rebecca goes to her drawer and pulls out Sara's silver chain.\n\n          Which she caresses in her hand.\n\n\n\n          INT.

FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n\n\n          A raucous party in full swing. Stephen's band has just\n\n          finished playing and he's walking off the cheap stage.

She closes the door. Jason\n\n          barely acknowledges the noise in his sleep.\n\n          Rebecca walks to the bed in the soft moonlight. She stares\n\n          down at Jason. She slips off her dress, which falls to the\n\n          floor. She's in just bra and panties now.\n\n          She climbs onto the bed beside Jason.
