For a few moments, we hear only\nthe soft scratching of pencil on paper, as credits are written\nin a series of dissolves. The hand carefully erases and\ncorrects an error or two along the way. And then the sound of\nan old friend... the warm crackle of a vinyl record... as we\nnow hear Alvin and the Chipmunks' \"Christmas Song.\"\n\n2 EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN -—- DAY 2\n\nA lone palm tree rises up into a yellow afternoon sky. Behind\nit, the sparkling blue of the Pacific Ocean and the city of\nSan Diego. A dry, hot Southern California day. Even the wind\nis lazy, and a little bored.\n\n3 EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD SHOPPING CENTER -— DAY 3\n\nSanta Claus wears shorts and sandals, ringing a bell as he\ncollects for the Salvation Army. This is Christmas in the\nSouthland. No snow, no winter wonderland. Just a pleasantly\nthick heat and an unchanging season, as music continues.\n\nTurning the corner, walking into frame is ELAINE MILLER, 35.\nShe is a tall woman, consumed by the fevered conversation she's\n\nHaving with her pale young son WILLIAM, late pre-teens. They\nstand apart from the other shoppers. All around them is the\nhighly-charged salesmanship of the season... silver glittering\nfake Christmas trees. She hurries her son through the\ncommercial juggernaut, continuing their lively intellectual\nconversation, when something stops her. A Workman is affixing\nletters to a store-front. He has already placed the MERRY...\nnow he's finishing the XMAS. Elaine is strong, but always\npleasant, always clear about her purpose in this life.\n\nELAINE\nExcuse me, I'm a teacher. There is no\nword in The English Language -- \"Xmas.\"\nIt's either Merry Christmas... or Happy\nHolidays.\n\nThe Workman nods thanks, with faux appreciation, as Mom turns\naway.",
