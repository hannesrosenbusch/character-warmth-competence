Steve opens the curtain and scans the\nsea of laughing faces in the crowd, getting high off their\nlaughter and the effect it’s having on his actors. Suddenly,\nhe looks into the audience and spots Lynn.\n\nLynn sees him too. The two look at each other for a long\ntime. The curtain goes down and everyone applauds. After\na few seconds, Lynn and Steve walk slowly towards each other.\nThere’s a few seconds of silence.\n\nSTEVE\nHey...\nLYNN\nHey...\nSTEVE\nco You... you look great.\n\n(CONTINUED)\n\f \n\n116.\n\nCONTINUED :\n—\n( LYNN\n\nThanks...\nSTEVE\n\nSo... what brings you down here?\nLYNN\n\nI wanted to see Pedro play the\n\nguitar. .\nSTEVE\n\nWhat?

You once told me I was a\nreally nice person.\n\nLYNN\nI believe I said that to Jeffy.\n\nSTEVE\nWell, we're the same guy. More or\nless. I mean, maybe I’m not as\ngood a dancer. And I don't dress\nas well. And...I'ma hell of a lot\nmore incoherent. : . .\n\nLynn smiles a bit, then looks away. Steve looks down.\n\n \n\n(CONTINUED) |\n\f \n\n(\n\n77 117.",

He reaches forward to give her a little hug. She pulls\naway.\n\n: GLEN\nCome on, Lynn! He’th thorry!\n\nLynn turns around.

Then, suddenly, one of\n\nhis fingers keeps bumping up against the strings, interfering\n--with his otherwise perfect performance. :\n\nWe CLOSE IN on his hand and see that one of his three fingers\n\nobviously didn’t “take” -— it’s still a useless ‘stump. ‘As the\n\nSpecial Olympians continue to sway to the music, we:\n\nFADE OUT.\n\n \n\f"
