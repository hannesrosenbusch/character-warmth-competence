Screaming steam shoots from the Calliope\nas mechanical arms overturn cars and loot stores.\n\nELMER\n(Maniacal Laugh)\n\nA dark figure drops down in its path. It’s DAFFY. He\nfaces off against the mechanical monstrosity. A steel\nclaw grabs for him; he leaps aside. He jumps on the claw.\n\nDaffy is hoisted skyward. He spies a small open panel on\nthe calliope. It is a maze of wires and circuits. In\nDAFFY'S COMPUTER-LIKE MIND, the circuits are analyzed in\n3-D and the system’s Achilles Heel is located.\n\nA grim Daffy plucks a feather from his chin and directs\nthe quill precisely into the circuit board.\n\nThe circuit crackles. The calliope shudders and bucks.\n\nThe calliope explodes into a fireball, which Daffy rides\ntoward camera a la “Mission: Impossible.”\n\nVOICE (0.S.)\nHold on.\n\nThe cartoon image on screen freezes.\n\nINT.
