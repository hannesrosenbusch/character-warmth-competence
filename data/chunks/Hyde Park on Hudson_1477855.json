I just had\nchores.\n\nWith toothbrush in mouth she moves her hair around, trying it\none way, then another.\nINT. DAISY’S HOUSE AUNT’S BEDROOM.

DAISY’S HOUSE PORCH. DAY.\n\nDaisy comes out onto the porch followed by two Scottie dogs;\nthe screen door slams shut behind her. The dogs start barking\nat the noise; she ignores them.\n\nDAISY VO\nAnd like most people during the\nDepression, I now lived each day as\nit came, no longer expecting\nanything.\n\nShe carries an empty milk bottle; with her foot -- she’s done\nthis so many times before - she flips open the top lid of a\nwhite wooden box on the porch. She takes out full milk\nbottle from the box, replacing it with the empty one.\n\nINT. DAISY’S HOUSE KITCHEN. DAY.\n\nDaisy stirs a pot of hot cereal on the stove, as she stares\nat the coffee percolating in the little glass bubble on the\ntop of the coffee pot.\n\nDAISY VO\nWaiting -- for nothing.\n\nThe Aunt, at the table, turns a page of a tired-looking, well-\nthumbed and old magazine.\n\fINT. DAISY’S HOUSE HALLWAY.

DAY.\n\nAN AIDE leads Daisy down the hallway which is full of people\nworking, sitting at make-shift desks, speaking in hushed and\nimportant-sounding voices. Others are typing ...
