I've never seen anything like it.\n\nINT. STRAYLIGHT - MAINFRAME CHAMBER\n\nThe floor suddenly SLAMS to a halt.\n\nThe mainframe's LASER WEAPONS swivel upward and fire at the Royal Guardsmen, \ncutting them down with criss-crossing arcs of deadly laser beams. The \ndestruction is swift and terrible.\n\nMaelcom and Case both badly wounded, slowly rise from the bullet-riddled floor. \nThe mainframe's overloaded circuitry rains sparks all around them.\n\nTHE MAINFRAME MONITOR\n\nThe screen is alive with streaks of crackling power swirling around the image of \na chromium sphere.\n\nCase leans on the control pedestal for support as he cries out to the computer \nentity before him.\n\nCASE\nWintermute...\n\nThe screens all around the chamber print out:\n\nWintermute is dead.\n\nAs Case and Maelcom watch in awe, the sphere rotates on its axis... revealing a \nbuddha-like face of glistening silver... Molly's face... but more than Molly. A \nNeuromancer unlike anything calculated by Wintermute.\n\nCASE\n(whispers)\nMolly...\n\nFor one brief moment, the eyes meet. A heartbreaking Mona Lisa smile graces \nMolly's lips, then her chromium eye lids rise for the first time... Beautiful \njade green eyes gaze lovingly into Case's.\n\nSuddenly the monitor explodes as the entire mainframe shorts out, bursting into \nflame.\n\nThe floor again begins to rise lifting Case and Maelcom out of the scene of \nspreading destruction.\n\nINT. SENSE/NET - MONITORING ROOM - EARTH\n\nTerminals explode as the systems overload. Personnel run for their lives.\n\nINT. STRAYLIGHT DINING HALL\n\nElectrical systems are shorting out overhead as oily smoke pours out of the \nventilation system. Case helps Maelcom past the wreck of the flying pulpit just \nas two guards enter the room and open fire. Case wheels about and guns them \ndown.\n\nThe floor shakes with the WHUMP of a huge explosion somewhere deep in \nStraylight.\n\nEXT. VILLA STRAYLIGHT\n\nThe entire structure is catching fire. Portions of the villa are rocked by \ninternal explosions.",
  "86": "END OF PREVIOUSLY ANNOTATED SECTION:\nEXT. VILLA STRAYLIGHT\n\nThe entire structure is catching fire. Portions of the villa are rocked by \ninternal explosions. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\n The air taxi rises out of the billowing smoke and flies \nstraight out of Freeside.\n\nEXT. FREESIDE\n\nThe air taxi shouts out of the slowly rotating tube into the black void of \nspace. In the distance is the blue marbled sphere of EARTH.\n\nINT. AIR TAXI\n\nCase tends to Maelcom's wounds with the ship's med kit as Freeside drops away in \nthe distance.\n\nCASE\nDo we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?\n\nMAELCOM\nDon't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.\n\nCASE\nWe're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.\n\nThe on board computer suddenly CRACKLES to life. Navigational charts and \ntrajectories appear.\n\nMAELCOM (CONT.)\nWhat is it?\n\nCase inspects the screen, slowly realising its significance.\n\nCASE\nTrajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...\n(turns to Maelcom)\nIf we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.\n\nMAELCOM\nJah guides us.\n\nCASE\nMaybe so...\n\nCase looks back down at the monitor.\n\nCASE (CONT.)\nBut Molly's taking us home.\n\nC.U. THE SCREEN\n\nThe softly glowing words remain:\n\nTo love and be loved is everything.\n\nCASE\n\nPresses his hand to the cool glass of the screen. The first tear rolls down his \ncheek.\n\nEXT.
