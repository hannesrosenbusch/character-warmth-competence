He sees Subbu changing, through the\nshaving mirror. He leaves his razor on the tray and turns\ntowards Subbu. He starts to lecherously fondle her from\nbehind. Subbu is frozen, mildly disgusted with her\npredicament.\n\nHe tries really hard to make out with her. She doesn’t\nprotest, but lies like a log of wood. He’s unable to attain\nan erection .
