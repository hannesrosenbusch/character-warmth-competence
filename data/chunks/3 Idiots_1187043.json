Lage Raho Munnabhai: The Original Screenplay was published last year.\n3 Idiots: The Original Screenplay is our second attempt in this direction. This book\nis not just the screenplay; it is also a peek into the minds of its makers.\n\nI would like to thank Smriti Kiran who took the initiative to come up with this\nbook within 5 months of the release of the film. She has spent many long days\nand long nights chasing the cast and crew, writing and rewriting, with a smile on\nher face. Without her persistence, this book would not have happened.\n\nI would also like to thank Ajay Mago and his team at Om Books International for\ngiving shape to our vision.\n\nTalso wish to thank Maheep Dhillon for tirelessly redrafting the screenplay; Supriya\nKelkar for her eye for detail; Rohan Mapuskar for poring over the dialogues;\nDileep Desai, Amit Gulati, Mustafa Neemuchwala, Teja Pratap, Insia Lacewalla for\nproduction support; Anupama Chopra for her invaluable insight.\n\nAnd Vinod Chopra for clearing all obstacles as always.\n\n— Rajkumar Hirani\n\n02_Acknowledgements.indd 7 5/31/2010 1:46:14 AM\n\f02_Acknowledgements.indd 8 5/31/2010 1:46:17 AM\n\fINTRODUCTION\n\n \n\n03_Introduction.indd 9 5/31/2010 1:47:14 AM\n\f03_Introduction.indd 10 6/31/2010 1:47:17 AM\n\fEvery story has a back story and so does mine.\n\nMy father, Suresh Hirani, was fourteen years old when he along with the family\nmoved to India during Partition.

There were more pressing and immediate concerns like food,\nclothes, and shelter to worry about. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n To make ends meet, my father started working\nin a bangle factory where he painted patterns on bangles. Later, he began selling\nice-cream on the streets. Despite compelling and adverse circumstances, his thirst\nfor knowledge did not wane.\n\nMy father’s sister, who was married in Nagpur, got him a job there in a general\nstore as a store attendant. The city brought with it opportunity. My father enrolled\nhimself in night school. Work in the day and classes at night continued and he\nsomehow managed to graduate. Fortified with a degree and some savings, he was\nitching to grow. So when a friend suggested that typewriters, which were new at\nthe time, were the future, my father decided to explore this avenue. He invested\nhis life’s savings, borrowed the rest of the money needed and opened a typewriting\ninstitute which was referred to as a ‘Commerce Institute’ then. My father christened\nit ‘Rajkumar Commerce Institute’. I was not even born then. So now you know\nthat I was named after a typewriting institute and not the other way round! Most\nparents would name their enterprises after their children, but I’ve had the rare\nhonour of being named after my father’s enterprise. I’m proud of that fact.\n\nMy father’s business flourished. He got married and I was born soon after. The\nplan was to get into engineering but I didn’t have enough marks in my higher\nsecondary exams (12th standard) to make the cut so I studied commerce. I had\nalso enrolled in this foundation course for chartered accountancy simultaneously,\nthe classes for which were held in the evenings. At the end of the foundation\n\n03_Introduction.indd 11 6/31/2010 1:47:17 AM\n\fcourse, the exams for chartered accountancy were to be held. I despised these\nclasses from the very beginning. I had no interest in chartered accountancy and\nthese classes were a huge imposition, both in terms of time and the fact that I was\nwasting this time on something I knew was not for me. But I had the baggage of\nthe engineering debacle on my head so abandoning this very viable option would\nhave appeared self-indulgent, foolish, and luxurious at the time.",

But I had the baggage of\nthe engineering debacle on my head so abandoning this very viable option would\nhave appeared self-indulgent, foolish, and luxurious at the time. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n I was afraid I\n\n \n\n \n\nRajkumar Hirani with his father, Suresh Hirani. Photo Credit Himmat Singh Sekhwat, Tehelka\n\nwould hurt my parents and also somewhat scared to take this step that could harm\nmy ‘future’. I carried on with the charade.\n\nSubconsciously, I was aware that there were some set presumptions about my future.\nI was expected to either become a chartered accountant or take over my father’s\nbusiness. Both possibilities mortified me. Though at that point in time, I was not\nthinking about what would make me happy. Like any normal person, I had\nresponsibilities and the usual concerns that range from job to future to career. As\n\n12\n\n03_Introduction.indd 12 6/31/2010 1:47:17 AM\n\fthe time for the foundation course’s exams drew close, I would often wake up in\nthe middle of the night in cold sweat.\n\nFinally, the exams were upon me. I realised that there was no escaping the inevitable.\nIt was imperative to tell my father that I found a root canal procedure more exciting\nthan chartered accountancy. Even after twenty years, that evening is as clear in my\nhead as if it had happened just yesterday.\n\nTt was a regular evening in Nagpur but for me it was going to be the most significant\nand decisive evening of my life. My father was standing alone in the living room.\nI walked in and walked up to where he was standing, taking lead-laden steps. My\nthroat was dry with uncertainty and fear. It was one thing to tell your father that\nyou did not want to pursue what seemed like an excellent career choice but it was\nanother thing to not offer an alternative plan. The only thing I was clear about\nwas that chartered accountancy was not my cup of tea. My voice quivered with\napprehension as I told him that I did not want to take the exams because I did\nnot enjoy chartered accountancy at all. He looked at me and then in the most\nnonchalant manner told me to not do it and join his office starting next morning.\nIt was as short and simple as that. I was ecstatic. The weight of the world had lifted\nfrom my shoulders. I felt free.",
  "5": "---END OF PREVIOUS SECTION---\nI was ecstatic. The weight of the world had lifted\nfrom my shoulders. I felt free. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n This happened during the period leading up to the\nfestival Makar Sankranti which is known for kite flying. I remember running up\nto our terrace right after ‘the conversation’ and flying kites with this silly grin on\nmy face. Now, the kite flying seems almost like a symbol for the sense of freedom\nand relief that had swept over me that day.\n\nMy commerce classes in college occupied only four hours of my time in the\nmorning (7 am to 11.00 am), so the rest of my time was devoted to helping my\nfather with his business (11.30 am to 6.30 pm) which had graduated from typing\ncourses to repairing and selling new kinds of calculators and other office equipment.\nI immersed myself in it with the gusto of a man who had just been extracted from\nthe gallows. I used to teach typing, go out and give demos to prospective clients,\nand repair spoiled units. I was even sent to Delhi to do a course in repairing\nelectronic calculators.\n\nThis is the period where I had my first brush with theatre. I met Narendra Thakur\nand a few other students who used to perform and produce plays regularly at our\ncollege. I joined them. (Before this, my only experience on stage was in the 9th\nstandard. I was cast in the role of ‘Noorjahan’ in a play.) I became a regular with\nthe theatre gang. Abandoning the foundation course opened up my evenings to\n\n13\n\n03_Introductionindd 13, 6/31/2010 1:47:22 AM\n\fbe occupied, and occupied they were with writing, reading, and brainstorming\nabout plays. This stirred something within me. I have always believed that there\nare two approaches to learning: one is to study something academically and the\nother is to get interested in something and then start to gather material on it and\nlearn about it. The latter is always a more gratifying experience. I would hunt for\nHindi plays in quaint bookshops. I would devour anything on theatre. We would\nparticipate in competitions, youth festivals, and travel to any place that even\nhinted at an opportunity for exposure in the field. Youth festivals were a platform\nwhere teams from all the colleges in Nagpur came and performed.",

We would\nparticipate in competitions, youth festivals, and travel to any place that even\nhinted at an opportunity for exposure in the field. Youth festivals were a platform\nwhere teams from all the colleges in Nagpur came and performed. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n At one such\nfestival, I met another theatre group which was performing for the Nagpur Medical\nCollege. There were a few people in that group, especially Debashish Naha, who\nwere passionate about theatre and took this enterprise very seriously. There was\nan instant connection with Debashish and soon our friendship led to my theatre\ngroup merging with his to form a new theatre group called Awaaz. Debashish and\nI would spend hours working on plays. He would get me plays written in Bangla\n\n \n\nFinding his voice ... performing on stage (middle) for Awaaz, in Nagpur.\n\n14\n\n03_Introductionindd 14 6/31/2010 1:47:22 AM\n\fand we would sit down and translate them in Hindi. We started putting up plays\nunder our banner. Personalities such as Marathi theatre-director Kishore Kulkarni,\nwho had received acclaim on stage were invited to direct plays for our group. We\nlearnt under many such people who had a command over their craft and a natural\nflair for the medium. Since everyone was busy till 6 pm everyday, we used to meet\nafter that. These meetings were held either at the Bengali Association Hall or at the\nSindhi Gurudwara nearby which had a hall, or at the local school hall. Wherever\nwe found some empty space, we parked ourselves. The rehearsals used to go on\n\ntill midnight.\n\nWe pursued this with such passion that theatre soon became an obsession. We\nmanaged to put up a record three to four plays a year. These plays were not restricted\nto performing at colleges. We started putting up ticketed shows. Apart from the\ncreative aspect, the entire production of the play was handled by us. We organised\neverything from booking the hall, putting up the sets, props, costumes, accounts,\nand even ticketing. Watching plays was not the preferred pastime in Nagpur, so we\nused to sell the tickets to friends and relatives. Accounts were maintained diligently.\nIn fact, I still have some of the accounts from those days. We used to barely cover\nour production costs and that is all we wanted. We were not doing this for profit.\nWe just wanted to be able to put up plays and hoped to cover costs and use the\nmoney to put up the next one.",

We just wanted to be able to put up plays and hoped to cover costs and use the\nmoney to put up the next one. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n On those rare occasions, if anything was earned over\nand above the production cost, it ensured a grand meal for our entire group.\n\nIt was not difficult to speak to my father the second time. Intuitive and observant,\nhe was not blind to my growing passion for theatre. The suggestion to tread this\npath in earnest came from my father. He told me to enrol in a program to get\nformal education (my father is a great believer in learning) in the field of writing,\ndirecting, and storytelling. The natural choice was to apply to the Film and Television\nInstitute of India (FTI).\n\nMy first attempt (1983) to get into FTII in the direction course was unsuccessful. I\nhad very little knowledge of the exam and the enrolment procedures. I had travelled\nto Mumbai to take the exam. There I learnt that the entrance exam for FTII was\nexactly like bank exams, and anyone studying for it would clear it without blinking. I\nalso realised that seats for the direction course were few and almost everyone applied\nfor this course. I came back to Nagpur and enrolled myself in the Faculty of Law as\nthat seemed like a reasonable option if things did not work out. Alongside, I started\npreparing for the FTII exam. The next year (1984), I applied again to FTII but\n\n15\n\n03_Introduction.indd 15 5/31/2010 1:47:30 AM\n\f \n\nLearning the grammar of cinema ... at FIL.\n\nthis time for the editing and not the direction course. I got admission. The day I\nreceived the telegram, informing me about my admission to FTII, was the happiest\nday of my life. I was delirious with joy. I thought I had arrived and my life was\nmade. This thought stemmed from naiveté. Sitting in Nagpur, I had only heard of\nthe ten to fifteen names of really successful people who had graduated from FTII\nso I assumed that getting admission meant I was set up for life. I looked at my\nadmission in the Institute as one looks at getting into law school or engineering.\nOnce you get in and work hard, the moment you graduate, you become a director.\nAll these illusions were shattered two days into my time at FTII. My enthusiasm\nwas replaced by an inferiority complex.",
  "8": "---END OF PREVIOUS SECTION---\nOnce you get in and work hard, the moment you graduate, you become a director. All these illusions were shattered two days into my time at FTII. My enthusiasm\nwas replaced by an inferiority complex. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n I was from a small town in the midst of\nstudents waxing eloquent about theories, films, and ideas that were Greek and\nLatin to me. It took me time but I found my feet again and got my voice back.\nIt taught me a very important lesson: you cannot lose yourself just by perceiving\nyourself to know less. If stereotypes have to be broken, then first they have to be\nbroken within you.\n\n16\n\n03_Introduction.indd 16 5/31/2010 1:47:30 AM\n\fThus, began the journey of disillusionment and enlightenment, unlearning and\nlearning, passion, failure, and fulfillment. After three years at FTII, I moved to\nMumbai (1987) and stayed with my friend and batchmate Sriram Raghavan\n(filmmaker). My first job was as an editor on an advertisement directed by Bharat\nRangachari. After this, I was recommended by late editor Renu Saluja and I edited\na documentary. I was paid Rs 1500 for my first job and Rs 500 for the second one.\nBut things were slow to come by. After sometime, the situation became precarious.\nVideo had just exploded on the scene so we were hard pressed for assignments as\nwe did not know how to edit on video. I could not even turn to my father for\nhelp because he was going through a financial slump. His business of typewriters\nhad taken a beating because of the arrival of computers. So both my father and I\nwere facing what you can term a ‘technological gap’.\n\nThe first year in Mumbai (1987), after passing out from the Institute, was a difficult\none. I came very close to giving up during that year. There were many dark nights\nof the soul. I thought about going back to Nagpur. Maybe do something related\nto cinema there. It was a matter of survival, and the strangest options came to my\nmind. I entertained the idea of shooting marriage videos creatively and putting a\ncompletely unique spin to them. Maybe do multiple camera set-ups and scale things\nup considerably. Exports, which was a much talked about thing back then, was the\nother option that came to mind. I went to Fort in Mumbai (there are many street\nvendors of second-hand books in Fort) and picked up a book on exports.",

I went to Fort in Mumbai (there are many street\nvendors of second-hand books in Fort) and picked up a book on exports. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n I was\ndesperately groping in the dark trying to hold on to something. Fortunately, FTII\nrevived its one-month video course that was promised to us. We rushed back to\nthe Institute for the course. After one month, we returned to Mumbai with the\nknowledge of what would be our survival kit in the city: video editing.\n\nI joined an editing studio called Ekta Studio (1988) as an in-house editor on a\nmonthly salary of Rs 1000. My six-month stint here gave me enough contacts and\nclout in the market to get regular work. I told myself, rather theatrically, that it\nmattered not if I didn’t make a lot of money: this life I have devoted to cinema. I\nconvinced myself with something as dramatic as that. Once you accept this, then\nthe dark nights disappear and all nights convert to being nights of battle: the battle\nto become better, to excel, to strive towards quality.\n\nDuring this phase of finding my feet in the business, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, my peer\nfrom FTII, who was assisting Vinod, called me to edit the promos of 1942: A Love\nStory (1992). But things did not go beyond that just yet. Meanwhile, from editing I\n\n17\n\n03_Introduction.indd 17 5/31/2010 1:47:34 AM\n\fhad moved up to directing advertising films and opened my own production house\ncalled Canvas Films (1991).\n\nIn 1998, I was called in to edit the promos of Kareeb as well because Vinod had liked\nmy work on 1942: A Love Story. This was again a one-off stint. I continued doing\nwork in advertising. Canvas Films flourished and I became financially secure.\n\nI had settled into a comfortable pattern till the morning I received a call from\nVinod (2000). He wanted me to edit Mission Kashmir. Not just the promos but the\nentire film. Initially, I was reluctant as I did not want to leave a lucrative set-up.\nBut once I learnt of Renu’s condition (Renu, Vinod’s first wife and film editor, was\nsuffering from cancer and her condition was going from bad to worse with each\npassing day), I could not say no.",

Watching cinema being made\nwith such passion and commitment by Vinod and his team rekindled the spirit in\nme that I had in my theatre days.\n\n* #,\n\n   \n\n2\n\n   \n \n \n\n&\n\n7\ncv\n\na\n\nMiles to go before I sleep ...\n\n18\n\n03_Introductionindd 18 5/31/2010 1:47:34 AM\n\fI knew I was ready to make a film. And I began working on writing my first film.\nHow Munna Bhai came about is another long story but that I will keep for the\nbook on Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.\n\nSo why did I just spill my guts and share my life with you?\n\nSimply because so much of 3 /diots is personal. 1 am a small town man from\nNagpur with no connections or background in films. I started working towards\nsomething that made me happy and that is all there is to it. I worked with passion\nand honesty, and even if success had not come my way, I would still have been\nreally happy as I got to chase my dreams.\n\nIt has been a long and wonderful ride, but the key here is, it has been a ride of my\nchoice. The desire to make 3 Idiots stemmed from this thought. I am not trying\nto say that engineering or chartered accountancy or any other profession for that\nmatter is any less than wildlife photography or filmmaking, and so on. My belief is\nsimple. Choose your own path. Choose without fear. It is not a foolproof formula\nfor happiness or success but it is definitely one that is most likely to work.\n\n— Rajkumar Hirani\n\n19\n\n03_Introduction.indd 19 5/31/2010 1:47:35 AM\n\f03_Introduction.indd 20 5/31/2010 1:47:96 AM\n\fTHE ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY\n\f\fEXT.

I would wake up in cold sweat,” he said. Raju\nattributes this to the fear psychosis created around exams and grades in India. The\nfirst few daunting months at FTII, a year without work and money in Mumbai,\nmyriad struggles to set up a career, the Herculean task of making movies were lesser\nstrains compared to the pressures of Higher Secondary exams in his life.\n\nIt was no surprise then that when he started hunting for a subject he felt deeply\nabout as the DNA for his first feature film, he decided on the story of three friends\nin a medical college. The aim was to weave a tale that enthralled with anecdotes\nfrom life in a hostel and make a comment both on the education system and the\nmedical practice in India. For Raju, life in a hostel signified freedom. The time he\nspent doing theatre with his group Awaaz with the students from Nagpur Medical\nCollege, hostel life at FTI, and the horrors of education engineered towards grades\nwere experiences that had left an indelible impression on him.

The script and the ideas kept\nchanging and evolving. At the end, the three friends had to wait and give way to\nthe duo that became the Indian equivalent of Batman and Robin: the incorrigible\nand immensely endearing Munna and Circuit.\n\nBut the initial idea that he started with lay latent in Raju’s subconscious for the\nnext six years. Such must have been his desire to make this film one day and\nso great the need for the world to have this idea translated on screen that the\n\funiverse conspired to make it happen. Vidya Balan and the Mumbai deluge of\n2005 played significant roles in pulling this blueprint out from the deep recesses\nof Raju’s mind. It was May 2005 and Vidya had just finished shooting for the\nfirst schedule of Lage Raho Munna Bhai. She and Raju had struck up an instant\nrapport often recommending interesting films and books to each other. Vidya\nhappened to read Five Point Someone during this period. She knew Chetan so she\nwas aware that he was keen to get the book across to Raju as possible material\nfor a film. Vidya immediately lent her copy of the book to Raju saying that this\nwas an idea she felt had legs. But being in the middle of making a film, Raju\ndid not have time to breathe let alone read. The book gathered dust on his\nbookshelf for sometime. And then in July, Mumbai faced the worst rain-induced\nfloods ever. Life for everyone in Mumbai came to a standstill. Raju’s lane was\ncompletely flooded and he had no choice but to stay home for a couple of days.\nThat is when he picked up Five Point Someone and read it. The story of three\nfriends and their experiences in an engineering college took him by surprise and\nbrought to the fore his first draft of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. He discussed it with\nVinod and Abhijat. The rights to adapt the book into a film were bought and\nthe rest as they say is history.",

The rights to adapt the book into a film were bought and\nthe rest as they say is history. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\nThe one-liner (a scene-wise synopsis of the screenplay and its trajectory) of 3 Idiots\nwas ready in a record nine days and the first draft of the screenplay with dialogues was\nready in 18 days from the day Abhijat Joshi, Vidhu Vinod Chopra, and Rajkumar\nHirani started working on it (2006). After that, it took the three writers, two-and-\na-half years to arrive at a shooting script.\n\nThe evolution of the screenplay involved ponderous work on innumerable drafts,\nmultiple scenarios (some retained and many abandoned), copious amounts of green\ntea, long walks, and several trips around the globe.\n\nThe journey was through a labyrinth of possibilities. [In some drafts Pia was Farhan’s\nex-girlfriend; Chatur and not Suhas was to marry Pia; Farhan was an unhappy\ncorporate honcho in New York; instead of wildlife photography, linguistics was\nFarhan’s passion; Joy and Phunsukh Wangdu were added and deleted frequently.]\nThe key to the screenplay was to find the best way forward that enabled the narrative\nto be consistently compelling, real, and entertaining.\n\nThese interviews with the writers were recorded between January and April 2010,\nat various locations, in Mumbai.\n\n322\n\fThere is a method to the three of you working together. How does it work?\n\nVC: We have been working together for many years and have immense mutual\nrespect and affection for each other. Abhijat and I go back to the Kareeb days\nand with Raju my writing association started with Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. 1 don't\nsit with them and write continuously. My biggest contribution and challenge is\nto channelise their passion and energies in a direction. I am their rubbish radar.\nThey do the writing and come to me constantly with material at regular intervals.\nI either change some things or add new things to it or reject it. My work here is\nof a good reviewer.\n\nRH: Abhijat and I write constantly while working on the screenplay and once we\nhave a ready draft, we start the sessions with Vinod. He is brilliant at catching\nthe problems, the chinks in the script, the flaws. It is fantastic to get this kind of\nperspective on one’s work as one is going along.",

It is fantastic to get this kind of\nperspective on one’s work as one is going along. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n It keeps us on the right track.\n\nAJ: The interesting thing about the three of us working together is the diversity\nin our methods of working which eventually enhances the material we work on.\nVinod’s method of writing and Raju’s and my methods are completely different but\nour goal is the same: a great story.\n\nRaju and I operate by working on individual scenes and later binding them\ntogether which brings the desired unpredictability to our work whereas Vinod\nlikes his character arcs and plot defined. Therefore, when we take the scenes to\nVinod, he lends the necessary prespective to them. The principle which has been\nthe guiding metaphor throughout Aristotle's writings has been that the action of a\nnarrative or drama must be presented as “a complete whole, with its several incidents\nso closely connected that the transposal [shifting an incident/scene from one point in\nthe narrative to another] or withdrawal of any one of them will disjoin and dislocate\nthe whole.” This is the principle that Vinod follows. His focus is the whole. Every\nscene in the film must carry the story forward. It must have a purpose that serves\nthis movement. You cannot narrate a scene to Vinod and tell him that the purpose\nof the scene is to make people laugh or cry. He will immediately throw it out.\nScenes might be luminous on their own but they are useless if they do not light\nup the whole narrative is Vinod’s belief. Raju and I often get carried away by the\nindividual scenes. In the second half of 3 diots, Vinod took out a few dramatic\nscenes which in hindsight I feel would have weakened our film. He believes that\nwe cannot overload the audience because after a while, they stop caring. There is\nFatigue that sets in. You need to have that balance where you don’t give in to the\n\n323\n\ftemptation of overdoing things. To give you an example, the speech scene was\nkept not because it was funny but because it had a purpose beyond making the\naudience laugh. The speech demonstrated the pitfalls of rote learning and brought\nthe conflicting philosophies in the film, of chasing excellence and blindly chasing\nsuccess, out in the open.\n\nThis is the way in which we work together. Different perspectives enable us to\nretain quality without losing focus.",

This is the way in which we work together. Different perspectives enable us to\nretain quality without losing focus. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\nThe germ of the idea came from Chetan Bhagat’s book Five Point Someone.\nWhat is it that drew you to the book?\n\nRH: I loved the description of hostel life in the book. It instantly held my attention.\nI had lived in a the hostel, like the boys in the book, so it was very appealing to\nme. Education and the pressures one faces with regard to education that would result\nin a ‘better life’, the one defined by society and not necessarily by the individual,\nhave always been of great interest to me. This gave me a wonderful opportunity to\ncombine these thoughts with a few anecdotes from the book.\n\nIt took over two-and-a-half years for the screenplay to come together. What\nwere the challenges that you faced while writing it?\n\nRH: Five Point Someone, though immensely enjoyable, was very anecdotal in its\ntreatment. I knew the moment I read the book that we would have to spend\nconsiderable time adapting it into a screenplay. There is nothing in the book that\nbinds it together. For a film, a binding thread is critical. The audience has to be\ntaken on a journey through the characters and plot. It has to move towards something\nto hold the attention of the viewers. For example, in Lagaan, one of the things\nthat keeps you hooked till the end is the cricket match. The whole film is moving\ntowards that. I could not find this thread within the book and from there stemmed\nthe desire to create an external story. The idea for the external story came to me in\nKenya. The Kenyan Film Board had invited a select group of Indian film directors\nand cinematographers to explore Kenya as a shooting destination for Indian films.\nTherefore, Nikhil Advani, Shaad Ali, and I, including a few other directors and\ncinematographers, travelled to Kenya. Initially, as usual, I was very reluctant to go.\nWhat happens with me is that whenever I am invited to some place and if I am\nworking, I start thinking that it is a waste of time, and, therefore, why should I go.\nThis is the reason I decline most of the times and then I regret it. Twice over I passed\n\n324\n\fup the opportunity to go to Australia thinking that I am working on my script and\nit would be a waste of time.",

Twice over I passed\n\n324\n\fup the opportunity to go to Australia thinking that I am working on my script and\nit would be a waste of time. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n In both cases, I could have easily gone and come back\nand my life would not have changed. So when this invitation came, sometime in\nMarch 2007, I decided I must go. I went but out of habit carried my laptop with\nme hoping I would find time to get some work done there. On reaching Kenya,\nI discovered that they had a packed itinerary planned for us for each day of our\nstay. Obviously, they wanted to show us the maximum number of locations. The day\nused to start at 6 am and end at 9 pm. After two days of intense sightseeing, I got\nanxious about my script. I started getting very edgy. On the third day, I refused to\ngo. Nikhil and everyone else started laughing at me. I realised that if I told them\nthe truth, then I would not be able to escape so I lied and told them that I was\nnot well. They left without me. I took out my laptop and started working on my\nscript. Funnily, one lady who was with the film board, landed up in my room with\na doctor. I sheepishly told them that now I was better. Hopefully, when she reads\nthis she shall realise how pivotal this day of work in Kenya was to 3 Idiots.\n\nThat entire day, the one day I managed to work on my script, away from all phone\ncalls and distractions, I sat in my hotel room thinking about the story that I need\nto introduce to bind the film. That is when this thought about the bet between the\nrivals struck me. One friend goes away and then the other two search for him. For\nthe audience, the binding factor would then be — do they find this friend or not?\nIf they do find him, then what is the story of the friend? Why did he leave? Where\ndid he go? Does he win the bet or does he lose? At every stage, these questions\nwould be at the back of their minds. This desire and curiosity in the audience to\nget to the end of the film is the backbone of a screenplay. If I were to remove\nthis entire story from the screenplay, then the film becomes just a story set in a\ncollege and you are not really looking forward to anything. I remember I called\nAbhijat from there and told him this idea and he loved it.",

I remember I called\nAbhijat from there and told him this idea and he loved it. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n The icing on the cake\nwas Abhijat coming up with the imposter idea.\n\nAJ: The imposter idea in the film came from a real-life story. I knew a man\n(I cannot name him as he is someone from the industry) who actually did what\nthe real Ranchoddas does in the film. A man applies to FTII and gets through. He\nalso applies to an engineering college and gets selected. He gets selected in many\nplaces. He is a brilliant guy. Of all the entrance exams he clears, he decides to enrol\nin the engineering college. This brilliant guy is our imposter’s friend. The imposter\nwants to study cinema so he takes his friend’s permission and impersonates him. He\nstudies at FTII for three years posing as the brilliant guy who chose engineering.\n\n325\n\fThe imposter passes out of the Institute, joins the film industry, changes back to\nhis real identity and makes films. This real-life story, which not too many people\nknow about, inspired the whole Rancho-imposter track.\n\nRH: We combined the search and the imposter tracks and got the story of the\nfilm. The binding thread which was missing to keep the narrative moving was now\nin place. This was probably one of the most critical of the challenges we faced in\nwriting 3 Idiots.\n\n‘What according to you is the core of 3 Idiots?\n\nAJ: The first scene that we wrote for 3 Idiots was the conversation between Boman\nand Aamir at Joy’s funeral. This scene was in a different form and shape the first\ntime we wrote it. On the night of the suicide, Rancho goes up to the tower in\nthe campus, rings the bell, gathers the students and delivers a speech. But in this\nform, the scene became too dramatic, grim, and preachy. We worked for days to\nmake it more real and yet retain the drama and impact. The scene you see in the\nfilm felt more natural so we changed the speech to a conversation at the funeral.\nWe purposely chose to make the boy who commits suicide a Christian so that the\nfuneral is set in a cemetery. The grey of the cemetery and the rain gave the scene\nthe grim and colourless tone that we needed. This scene, according to me, is the\ncore of 3 Idiots.",

This scene, according to me, is the\ncore of 3 Idiots. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n Why should people be killing themselves? There is something wrong\nwith the system. Why is everyone running after grades and not knowledge? That\nis what the film addresses and attacks.\n\nVC: I agree with Abhijat. 3 /diots questions the system and its pitfalls. The pressure\nto chase grades leads students to give in to pursuits that might not be the ones of\ntheir choice and compels them to take the set and decided path to set and decided\ngoals. This only leads to suicides or mediocrity. Chasing excellence is not encouraged.\nExcellence over success is a philosophy I have always followed which has led me to\ntake some very irrational decisions that have made no business sense. But because\nthe pursuit was for quality, in the long run, success came in leaps and bounds.\n\nIt is a very personal film. Not only does it embody a philosophy that is close\nto your heart but it heavily borrows from your lives as well. Which portions\nin the film have been picked from your lives?\n\nRH: There is a lot in the film from the scenes to the quirks added to embellish\ncharacters to dialogues that we have taken from our lives. I used to know a guy\n\n326\n\fcalled Prasan Jain in FTII who once had a bath at the entrance gate of the campus\nto make the faculty aware that there was an acute water shortage in the hostel. So\nRancho bathing in the garden came from there. “Jahanpanah tussi great ho” is also\nborrowed from the Film Institute. We were ragged for an entire month after we\njoined. All throughout that month, if we spotted a senior, we had to pull down our\npants, bend over, pat our butts, and say, “Jahanpanah tussi great ho. Tohfa kubool karo.”\nThis practice was called Farshi. In my days at the Nagpur Medical College with my\ntheatre buddies, I got to know about this guy who used to slip magazines under\nthe doors of other students to distract them during exams. The competition there\nwas so fierce that people resorted to some really desperate things. The conversation\nbetween Farhan and his father is again inspired by the conversation I had with my\nfather which I have mentioned in detail in the introduction to this book.",

The conversation\nbetween Farhan and his father is again inspired by the conversation I had with my\nfather which I have mentioned in detail in the introduction to this book. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\nAJ: I have already told you about the impostor story. Apart from the search for the\nthird friend and the imposter track, the third primary element in the story is the\nbet between Chatur and Rancho. This bet signifies the clash of rival ideologies. We\ngot the idea for this from an anecdote from Vinod’s initial years in the industry. After\nthe trial of one of the films made by a big Bollywood producer, Vinod hitched a\nride with him in his posh car to be dropped to the nearest bus stop. The producer\nasked Vinod what he thought about the film. Vinod launched into shredding the\nscreenplay bit by bit and let the man know without mincing words that the film\nwas utter rubbish. The gentleman turned around and said, “Jadd vaddi gaadi lenga\nna tadd dekhanga tu kaisi picture banayenga” (When you get used to riding in a big\ncar, then we will see the kind of films you make). The producer’s point was simple:\nwhen you get used to the luxuries, it is what works at the box office that takes\nprecedence over the quality of cinema. Vinod got out of the car and swore that this\nis something he would never adhere to. He was clear from the beginning that the\nball game was cinema and not money. If you got the former right, then the latter\nwould follow. This clash of philosophies, of thought, money versus good cinema\nwas the trigger for the bet between Rancho and Chatur. The Rancho “definition\nof books and the machine” scene is my gift to Raju’s son Veer. Raju was helping\nVeer with his homework. One of the questions in the assignment was: Why do we\ncelebrate Good Friday? Veer’s answer to that was “to commemorate the resurrection\nof Christ.” Raju wanted to know if Veer knew the meaning of this answer. To his\nsurprise, Veer did not. Raju launched into explaining it to him and then asked Veer\nto write the answer the way he had understood it. But Veer was adamant that it\nhad to be written only in the manner that he had written it or his teacher would\n\n327\n\fnot be happy.",

But Veer was adamant that it\nhad to be written only in the manner that he had written it or his teacher would\n\n327\n\fnot be happy. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n Easy or uncomplicated language and, most importantly, veering away\nfrom the expected and accepted form of the answer was not an option. Raju was\nvery baffled and concerned about this. He told me this story over the phone and\nit became the genesis of the Rancho-Professor ‘definition-of-machine’ face-off.\n\nThe scene where Rancho, Farhan, and Raju go to Farhan’s house after the Director\nsends the warning letter to both Raju and Farhan’s parents is also inspired from\ntwo different incidents that happened in my life and Raju’s. Once, I had met a\nlady who was furious with her daughter. The daughter was a bright girl but the lady\nwas yelling at her because she had scored 91 per cent instead of 94 per cent. The\n3 per cent drop was unacceptable. The insanity of this mad race for marks left me\namused and disturbed at the same time. When we were writing this scene, I really\nwanted to incorporate this. While at FTII, Raju with his Institute friends used to\ntravel to Mumbai often over the weekends. On one such weekend, a friend of his\ninvited them to his house for dinner. They all landed up at his place eager to devour\nthe free food so looked forward to in those money-strapped college days. The friend\nwho invited them and his mother had had a big fight. They sat in silence waiting\nfor the announcement that the food is ready. After two hours, the mother got up\nand told the boys, “Beta agli baar aaoge to khaana zaroor kha kar jaana.” Raju still\nremembers this because it was close to midnight when they were asked to leave and\nthey were famished with barely over twenty rupees between all of them.\n\nThe watch track between Pia and Rancho again came from an anecdote that Vinod\nhad told me about ...\n\nVC: See I told you I cannot remember half the things. Abhijat has been gifted with\na photographic memory. A relative of mine was working in the Gulf and was very\nwell off. I was not doing that well then. During one of his visits, he was flaunting\nhis watch which cost a couple of lakhs. I heard him out and then exclaimed that\nthere must be something wrong with his watch.",
  "186": "---END OF PREVIOUS SECTION---\nI was not doing that well then. During one of his visits, he was flaunting\nhis watch which cost a couple of lakhs. I heard him out and then exclaimed that\nthere must be something wrong with his watch. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n He was taken aback and frantically\nexamined his expensive watch. There was nothing wrong with it according to him\nso he asked me to explain myself. ‘Aapki ghadi itni mehngi hai aur meri sirf do sau\nrupyaye ki lekin phir bhi time same dikhateen hein” (your watch is very expensive\nand mine costs only Rs 200 but both of them tell the same time), was my reply\nwhich left him speechless.\n\nRancho propels the story forward. He illustrates the philosophy of the film. A\nlot of people felt that his character does not have an arc in the film. Rancho\n\n328\n\fenters the story, preaches, and then leaves. He is too perfect. How did Rancho as\na character evolve and did you have any fears and apprehensions that he might\nappear to be more fiction than real as he began to take shape?\n\nRH: The backbone of Rancho’s character which also separates him from everybody\nelse is his lack of fear. He is a brilliant, free-spirited, and honest boy who is\nchasing what he is interested in most. Probably a person without fear has become\nunfathomable today so Rancho might seem unreal to some but to me he is very\nreal. My first thoughts on Rancho were that he is a boy from a village who has had\nno experience with formal education so he does not know the fear of teachers. He\nspeaks to them as he speaks to everyone. I could have dwelled on his childhood\nand background a little more in the film to bring this to the fore but I eventually\nfelt that it was not necessary. Rancho lives by his philosophy and his beliefs. He\nmakes choices which are absurd conventionally but he is not here to conform and\nhe does not feel the need to.\n\nVC: Why does he appear superhuman? It was very easy for Raju, Abhijat, and\nme to flesh out Rancho as we understand him completely. In fact, I see a lot\nof myself in Rancho. There are just too many similarities. I was always a topper\nin my school. I remember being thrown out of class because I dared to ask my\nteacher who Hamlet was.",
  "187": "---END OF PREVIOUS SECTION---\nThere are just too many similarities. I was always a topper\nin my school. I remember being thrown out of class because I dared to ask my\nteacher who Hamlet was. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n In college, I found BA very boring so I used to attend\nMA classes and I even studied the books prescribed for MA Economics. In my\nBA exams, I scored only 55 per cent. I was a consistent topper with scores usually\nranging between eighties and nineties. I was sure that there was a mistake in the way\nI had been marked. I asked for a recheck and realised that the objections to some\nof the answers stemmed from the fact that I did not follow the pattern of writing\nthe expected answers. I was quoting writers and theories, with all due respect, which\nwere out of the purview of my teacher. Therefore, when I took my final BA exams,\nI wrote all my references with the page numbers and the titles of the books and\nthe authors. This is how I topped my BA exams. What surprised and baffled me\nthough was the resistance of the educators to reward inventiveness. This reluctance\nand rigidity is steeped in our education system. You would be surprised to know\nthat FTII had failed me. I was thrown out without a diploma. Then my student\nfilm, Murder At Monkey Hill, won the National Award and was also nominated\nfor an Oscar. The moment I won the National Award, FTII appointed me as a\nmember of their governing council. In this capacity, I spoke out against the staff\nas I was aware of everything that goes on there. The staff protested against me\nand said that I couldn't be on the governing council because I had failed. The\n\n329\n\fFTII management had to pass me then and I got my diploma. They had failed\nme because they wanted me to take a lot of exams, some of which I thought were\ncompletely ridiculous. For example, they wanted us to submit a feature film script\nwhich I never did. The reason for that was simple. I felt we were not yet trained\nto do this. I protested against these unfair practices. It gives me no pleasure to say\nthis but I did not have any teacher to look up to, and at that stage of your life,\na guiding force can be such a boon. These experiences and the lack of guidance\nbecame my reason to back talent. I am passionate about doing this because I never\nhad that privilege.",

I am passionate about doing this because I never\nhad that privilege. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n I learnt the English language at the age of 16 (as late as that)\nand what am I doing now? I am making a film in Hollywood. Even now, I have a\nproblem understanding my actors and I ask them to talk slowly because it is tough\nfor me to understand their accents.\n\nI can draw many parallels but the point I am making is that Rancho is not an\nunbelievable, fictional, larger-than-life character. He is probably someone who is a\nlittle tough to understand in this world because he does not conform. We are so\nhappy sitting back and accepting whatever is doled out that anyone who questions,\nis considered an aberration.\n\nAJ: While writing, we did not look at Rancho as a character in the film but as the\nhero of the film and he has been written like that, though he is neither superhuman\nnor a comic book hero. He has the attributes of a hero and it would be dangerous\nto pretend otherwise. He is an uninhibited free spirit with insatiable curiosity and\ngenuine queries. He does not operate with arrogance or cockiness and Aamir has\nalso played him with that inherent earnestness. But it would be incorrect to say\nthat he does not have an arc in the film or a journey. His journey in the film starts\nfrom Joy’s suicide. He would not have taken on the system had he not seen that a\nperfectly wonderful boy was driven to suicide because of the mechanical, unthinking,\nruthless system education has been reduced to. This stirs something inside him that\nhe cannot ignore. A clear inspiration and influence here was the film Deewar (1975).\nAmitabh Bachchan is a daily wage worker at the dockyard. All workers there have\nto pay extortion money to Peter, the local goon. One man refuses to pay this and\nhe is killed by the goons. The death of this innocent person changes Amitabh.\nHe decides to fight back. “Raheem Chacha ab woh hoga jo 25 saal mein nahin hua.\nAgle hafie se ek aur coolie inn darindon ko hafia nahin dene wala hai” (Something\nthat has not happened in 25 years will happen now. Next week one more worker\nwill not pay the extortion money to the goons), goes the famous dialogue.",

Next week one more worker\nwill not pay the extortion money to the goons), goes the famous dialogue. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n Without\nthis death which changes him, Amitabh would have remained just a worker content\n\n330\n\fto earn his daily wages. This incident, its futility and cruelty, changes him. While\nwriting Rancho, Raju and I had discussed this scene from Deewar. Therefore, Joy's\nsuicide is a turning point in Rancho’s life. This is his journey. And in the course\nof his own journey, he changes lives including his own.\n\nLike Rancho, Virus’s character must have been a challenge. How did you\nachieve balance there?\n\nRH: During Munna Bhai M.B.B.S., we were shooting a scene where Boman was\nto deliver a speech to the students. He improvised and added in the speech that a\ndoctor should be dispassionate towards his patients. He must maintain an emotional\ndistance to give him perspective. The exact line was: “Agar mein apni family par operate\nkaroonga to mere haath kampenge.” While scripting this, my debate with Boman was\nthat this argument is so logical and valid that it completely justifies Dr. Asthana’s\ncharacter. It makes my hero look weak. Boman looked at me and said that this\nwas my problem and not his. As an antagonist, he must have a point of view and\nif that point of view weakens the protagonist, then the director has to make the\nprotagonist stronger. This has stayed with me since then. I have consciously applied\nthis while constructing the characters in my films. This helps in creating characters\nthat are real and not one dimensional. Therefore, Virus despite his quirks has a ring\nof reality. His intention is not to go out there and harm students. He believes that\nlife is a race and if you don’t run fast enough, you would be left behind. This is\nhis point of view and he is unwavering in his belief.\n\nThe film starts with Farhan abandoning a flight that has already taken off. But it\nwas a long process before you arrived at this opening for the film. In the earlier\ndrafts I read, several approaches were tried including the one where you were even\ncontemplating bringing in Amitabh Bachchan as the narrator.

This\nwas done to establish the importance of Rancho in Farhan’s life.\n\nAJ: Though we went along with the airplane scene to open the film, I do have an\nalternate scene that happens to be my favourite. Given a chance, I would still do that\ninstead of this. In my favoured beginning, Farhan is a linguist and is in the middle\nof a conversation between two Heads of State at the UN. He is the interpreter. He\n\n331\n\fleaves this session to meet Rancho and these two men are left in the lurch. There\nis a lot of comedy that emerges from linguistics but we did not have enough time\nto develop it so we went along with the airplane scene. The airplane scene was also\nmore dramatic. But these things are a matter of exploration. One explores multiple\npossibilities and then chooses the one that best works for the film.\n\nJoy’s suicide was a critical point of debate. There are drafts that had it and\nseveral that did not. Its inclusion was probably most fiercely debated in the\nentire screenplay. It was felt that this was too dark an incident for this film or\nthat it might dilute the revelation of Virus’s son’s death being a suicide. What\nwas the thought behind the suicide scene and the reason for placing it within\n20 minutes of getting into the film?\n\nVC: There was a lot of back and forth that happened over this. I had serious\ndoubts about whether we should include this or not. But what convinced me was\nthat this gave motivation to Rancho’s character. Raju took it a step further by\nadding a montage and a voice-over at the editing stage. There is a small montage\nwith Farhan’s voice-over talking about Rancho and his quirky personality and from\nthere the voice-over says, “Ek aur tha bilkul Rancho jaisa.” And we cut to Joy. This\nvoice-over that Raju introduced at the editing table, integrated the Joy track into\nthe script. Otherwise, it would have been too much of a jump. It also illustrated\nthat a brilliant guy like Rancho can go one way or the other.",

Abhijat\nand I were very keen to keep it as we felt that the conflict in the film would start\nfrom there, otherwise it would just be a fun film without anything substantial in\nit. Vinod and Aamir felt that it should not be there. They thought that it was\ntoo dark and grim. It was a jarring inclusion in the film. But Abhijat and I were\nconvinced that this had to be there. This went on for a long time. In fact, we only\ngot it back into the script a month before the shoot started (September 2008).\nBut the debate over it continued and then finally the montage and the voice-over\nduring the edit, settled the matter. Earlier, the Rancho montage was not there in\nthe film. We had not even planned to keep it. Nevertheless, I shot it. Simply, so\nthat if I ever felt like reviving it, then it could be done. The feedback after the\nfirst screening of the film we organised for a sample audience revealed that Rancho\nbeing a mad genius was not coming across. I added the montage then and, linking\n\n332\n\fit with Joy’s introduction by that voice-over, made Joy both integral to the plot\nand also lent him credibility.\n\nAJ: Joy’s suicide is the spine of the film. The second-half revelations are climatic\ndevices. But Joy’s suicide is what makes Rancho realise that pressure to perform\nis the killer and it has to be fought. It is this belief that takes Rancho’s character\nand the story forward. Otherwise, why is he doing the things that he is doing? The\nfirst half of the film would become insubstantial if we took out the suicide.\nThe challenge was to put this thing that worries us about the system right on top\nso that we know what Rancho is fighting, and the film is saved from sinking under\nthe weight of this intense scene.\n\nThe interval point is a bit of a shock. The tone of the scene and the treatment\nare unlike the rest of the film. There were other interval points discussed as\nwell before arriving at this one.",

There were other interval points discussed as\nwell before arriving at this one. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n How did this come about?\n\nRH: I wanted the fact that Rancho is an imposter to be revealed earlier in the film.\nI felt if we stretched revealing this till the interval, then it would seem that this\nvery rich kid had come into a college and was having fun. I felt that the audience\nneeded to be told as quickly in the film as possible that he was an imposter because\nit would get the audience to feel for him. So in the earlier drafts, we came out of\nthe flashback one more time in the first half to reveal that Rancho was not actually\nRancho but an imposter. Then we went back into the flashback and there was a\ndifferent interval point (Farhan and Raju discovering that Pia is getting married\nbeing one of the options considered). But after a lot of thought and work on the\nscript, I felt that the interval would be a great point to reveal that Rancho was not\nRancho but an imposter. Sometimes, I still feel that it might have been better to\nreveal this earlier even though what we eventually put in the film is a great interval\npoint. In the end, these are choices that one makes. So once it was settled that this\nwas going to be the interval point, we narrated it to Vinod. He suggested that we\nadd the element of the college photograph having a different face on Rancho. This\nappealed to me as it enhanced the scene.\n\nVC: Unlike the West, Indian cinema does not follow the three-act structure which is\na two-act deal. It is a very unusual way of watching movies. No one else across the\nworld watches films like this — you see one part of the film, break for samosas and\nchai, then you watch the rest of the film. This makes the interval point extremely\ncritical. Therefore, one must invest a lot of thought in where the break would\nhappen. In this film, my thought process was focussed on the level of interest of\n\n333\n\fthe audience when they would go and buy their popcorn. Basically, their eagerness\nto come back to find out what happens next in the film is vital. When I made\nthe suggestion, I did not think that Raju would retain it. It lends a thriller-like\nquality to the twist. I felt that the audience would enjoy the suspense.",

I felt that the audience would enjoy the suspense. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n The first\ntime I told Raju, he said he liked it but I do not believe anything Raju says in the\nevening. It is an age-old joke between us that I am the ‘in-the moment guy’ and\nhe is the ‘next morning guy’. He likes to mull over and think over all the options.\nHe makes up his mind only after that. So I always go with what Raju feels about\nthings the next morning and not on the evening that they are suggested. I am\nhappy that he retained it.\n\nThe film initially ended with these people finding Rancho teaching in Ladakh\nin a school, leading a simple happy life doing what he loves doing. Phunsukh\n‘Wangdu was not in the film at all. How did the idea of Phunsukh Wangdu\nfall into place?\n\nRH: Yes, that is true. Phunsukh Wangdu was not in the film earlier. The film\nended with Farhan, Raju, and Pia reaching Ladakh and discovering that Rancho\nteaches in this fascinating little school and that is his success. Whatever he wanted\nto do, he did it. But we felt that maybe the audience would not understand this.\nThey would probably say that ‘yaar khush to hain, lekin paise to kam kamaata hai\nna” (He might be happy but he earns very little money). We felt that to make the\naudience understand, we had to show him to be successful in the conventional\nway. This is the reason we added the Phunsukh Wangdu, coveted-scientist angle\nand backtracked to plant him in the film. This is where Chatur’s quest emerged.\nHe was shown to be looking for someone in the entire film and at the end the\nman he is searching for is Rancho. The idea was to show a man living a simple life\nout of choice. Rancho has the option of signing a deal with anyone and raking in\nmillions but he has chosen to do differently. We felt this would help the audience\nunderstand things better.\n\nAnother reason was that we kept feeling that the climax was not great. It seemed\nthat our climax was the delivery and then we were just wrapping up the film in\nLadakh. It felt weak. We, however, were doing a lot of things in Ladakh.",

We, however, were doing a lot of things in Ladakh. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n First, we\nwere showing an unusual school. As Farhan, Raju, and Pia enter the school, they\nsee (an entire scene was there intially) that a race is going on, kids are running\nand one kid falls down. Instead of carrying on, all the kids run back to pick\nhim up and then proceed to finish the rest of the race. These guys look at each\n\n334\n\fother and say that this can only be Rancho’s school. Chatur’s electrocution scene\ninitially had Millimeter in it. So all this material was there but these pieces were\nnot coming together to result in a spectacular end to the film. When we found\nPhunsukh Wangdu, things started falling into place. But to clean this up and to\nget it all together at the end took us a lot of time. Finally, it evolved to become\na big twist at the end.\n\nWe solved the Phunsukh Wangdu riddle in our heads in Goa. Abhijat was on\na writing visit to Mumbai. I received a call to attend the Film Festival in Goa\n(IFFI, end 2007). We decided to travel to Goa for two days on this pretext. Any\nreason to get away from Mumbai and write. We stayed at the same hotel as the\none where we had shot the Lage Raho song with the old people. Abhijat got very\nexcited about it. He has this fascination for revisiting places that have a context.\nExcept for the chief minister’s party the night we had arrived, we did not attend\nthe festival at all. We took a long walk on the beach the day we arrived and\nPhunsukh Wangdu fell into place. It was quite magical and we were very happy\nwith the climax after that.\n\nPhunsukh Wangdu, the real identity of Rancho, is revealed at the end. The\npoint of revelation that Rancho is actually Phunsukh Wangdu is something\nyou battled with for over a year. What made you decide the final route?\n\nRH: This was a tough one to decide. We were unsure of this right up till the day\nbefore we shot the scene. Abhijat and I felt that it should be revealed the moment\nthe friends reunite, before Chatur’s arrival.",

But both Aamir\nand Madhavan were of the view that the revelation should happen at the end so\nthat the film ends on a high note. They felt that revealing it earlier would weaken\nthis dramatic twist. This is when the tussle started. Abhijat and I resisted for a\nlong time but Aamir and Madhavan were so vehement and insistent that it became\na question in our minds also. When I was in Ladakh for the shoot, I started to\nfeel that maybe their suggestion holds some weight. Maybe the surprise at the end\nwould be a great way to end the film. So I changed it and rewrote it in Ladakh a\nday before the shoot. Frankly, I still don’t know which route was better. Actually,\nit is a matter of interpretation. Both routes are correct in their own way.\n\n335\n\fChatur’s speech scene is a complete departure from the Raju Hirani sensibility\nand the overall VCF sensibility. There were also varied opinions about the\nshloka at the end of the speech. Were there any apprehensions at the time of\nwriting this?\n\nRH: I was aware that what we were doing with this film, we had not done before.\nThere was also complete awareness of the fact that we might be panned for using\nwhat people might label as toilet humour. There are ragging scenes with boys in\ntheir underwear. The language is of a certain quality and other things as well,\nbut while writing, we realised that the campus world we had created would look\ncompletely false if we didn’t use the language, the irreverence of youth, and the\nwhole college milieu while creating it. This is the way this world is and, therefore,\nour job was to stay true to this world. This was the necessity of this world.

This\nscene we cracked when Abhijat and I were in Columbus, Ohio (April 2007). \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n The\ndecision that Rancho will change Chatur’s speech was already in place but we had\nnot worked out the details of the scene yet. We decided to make it more challenging\nfor ourselves. It would have been easy to change the entire speech but if only a few\nwords were to be changed, then it would have been tough. Therefore, the challenge\nwas to write a speech that, if kept in its original format, sounded great but if you\nwere to change just a few words in it, then it would become completely different.\nWe struggled for many days to find the right words. We had thought about many\nwords and many ideas but nothing was good enough. We wanted it to rhyme too.\nOne day, we were out for a drive and we hit upon chamatkar’ and ‘balatkar’. But\nafter using this a few times, we felt that we needed a change because carrying an\nentire speech only on a single word change might get monotonous so the hunt\nfor the second word started. I was in Ohio then, visiting Abhijat. We were out\nfor a walk when the second word struck us (dhan’ and ‘ttan). Abhijat’s daughter\nAnoushka (age 12) was also with us. While Abhijat and I were talking, we cracked\nthis and Abhijat almost fell down laughing. We were both in splits but we could\nnot share this with Anoushka.\n\nThe shloka at the end is another story. It was not there in the scene. While writing\nthe screenplay, we had rented a small farmhouse in Pune where we used to go and\nwrite very often. During one of our writing sojourns in this farmhouse, in some\nother context and not in the context of this speech scene, Abhijat told me this\nshloka. laughed to the point of tears. I decided there and then that I wanted it\nin the speech scene and it was incorporated at the end of the scene. Since Chatur\nalready had this trait of farting and is called Silencer by everyone, the shloka fitted\n\n336\n\fin perfectly. But Vinod felt we should take it out. Later, even Abhijat felt the same.\nBut I was very keen to retain it.",
  "197": "---END OF PREVIOUS SECTION---\nBut Vinod felt we should take it out. Later, even Abhijat felt the same.

I really wanted it to be\nin the film so I was happy that eventually everyone came around to it.\n\nVC: (Blushing) I was very shocked by that shloka. But Vir loved it and I tested it\nthrough screenings on other people and they died laughing too. My objection had\nnothing to do with sensibility because as Raju said, one has to adopt the sensibility\nof the film and not some general sensibility. Therefore, there were no sensibility\nissues here. I just felt that the scene was getting too long and might be a bit of a\nstretch. My biggest concern is always that the audience should not be bored.\n\nAJ: The speech scene was hilarious but I must say that it was not in the script just\nas a set piece for humour. It is the illustration and the turning point for the clash\nof the ideologies which is the key element in the film. Rancho protests against rote\nlearning that our education system encourages. He is completely against it. The\n‘definition of a machine’ scene introduces that. The speech scene illustrates the ills\nof following blindly without understanding the meaning of things. It shows that\nChatur is end-oriented whereas Rancho worries about the journey. With the speech,\nthe battle of the philosophies becomes an open battle. Right after this scene, we\nhave the scene where Chatur and Rancho lay a bet to meet after ten years to see\nwho is more successful. The speech scene lent to the progression of this theme in\n\nthe film.\n\nThe shloka at the end is another story. I knew that if I told Raju this, he would\nimmediately want it in the film and that is what happened. Later in the edit, I too\nwas unsure about it like Vinod and like he said, it was not because of any sensibility\nissues. It was because I felt that Rancho probably would not meddle with the\nspeech to this extent. He would change just two words and that would be enough\nfor him to drive the point home.",

I remember you telling me that you began this film by first deciding\non the climax because that was a huge challenge you faced while writing Lage\nRaho? Frankly, what were you people thinking when you decided on this as\nthe concluding episode in the film?\n\n337\n\fRH: The origin of this scene is from Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.1 had thought of this\nscene where Munna gets admission into medical college. He has only done this to\nspite Asthana. He has no other motivation to study at a medical college other\nthan his disdain for Asthana. One night, he is roaming the streets with Circuit.\nThey are drunk. Munna is wearing the doctor's white jacket so that he feels like\na doctor. There is a Mumbai bandh’ that day. Both of them are crossing a chawl.\nA boy comes running out of the chawl and is hunting for an auto-rickshaw. His\nmother is pregnant and her waters just broke. He has to rush her to the hospital\nor find a doctor. He spots Munna and drags Munna into the chaw/ because he\nthinks that Munna is a doctor. These guys have no idea what to do but somehow\nthey get through the delivery. The idea behind the scene was to get Munna to\nrealise the value and responsibilities of doctors. The moment he held the newborn,\nthis would have hit him. Now, he would really want to study medicine. The\nscript underwent many changes and this route was abandoned. I had told Abhijat\nabout it. While writing 3 Idiots, like I told you earlier, we were determined to\nfirst decide the climax. Abhijat and I talk a lot when we are writing so this is\none of the scenes I mentioned again and Abhijat said, “Why don’t we use this\nhere?” Rancho could apply engineering for the delivery.",

Then, we spent a lot of time with\ngynaecologists to make it authentic. It became a big joke in office. Whenever\nVinod used to come to office and ask for us, he was told that we had gone to\nthe gynaecologist. Everyone teased us endlessly about our visits to gynaecologists.\nOne of my friends had introduced us to Dr. Sejal Desai who became our guide\nwhile writing this scene. She told us about the various procedures by which a baby\ncould be delivered. The only procedure which could be combined with engineering\nwas the suction method. A lot of people think that this cannot happen but the\nscene is totally authentic and it is possible to deliver a baby like this. At every\nstep, we consulted the doctors and, in a way, we wrote the scene with them. A\nlot of work, a lot of research, and a lot of time were spent on this. Even during\nthe shoot, the doctors were there and constantly monitoring what was happening\nand how it was being depicted. This is not one of those up in the air, fantasy\nthings that we have put in the film for the sake of a great climax.\n\nYou have often referred to the three scenes that constitute this continuous chunk\nin the film as the soul of 3 Idiots: Raju’s job interview, Farhan’s conversation\n\n338\n\fwith his father, and Rancho breaking down when they come and tell him\nabout their triumphs. These scenes had several rewrites before they took the\nfinal form in which they are in the film. Why do you feel that this chunk is\n\nthe essence of 3 idiots?\n\nRH: These are the moments in the film I am most attached to and they make me\nvery emotional. Even while narrating these scenes, I would often get choked with\nemotion. In a way, I feel, they are the crux of the film. I have always been fond\nof an underdog succeeding. I like hope. I see victory in hope. Be happy, go and\ndo whatever you want without fear. This is what one wants to say about life.",
  "200": "---END OF PREVIOUS SECTION---\nI see victory in hope. Be happy, go and\ndo whatever you want without fear. This is what one wants to say about life. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n We\nhad to put a lot of work into these scenes. For example, a lot of back and forth\nhappened in order to elevate the interview scene to the level we aimed to take it\nto. It was written and rewritten several times. Initially, Raju Rastogi was only saying\nthings about fear, god, and superstition and he used to get the job. I felt that the\nscene was flat. It lacked punch and impact. Then we hit upon the ‘attitude’ angle\nwhich transformed the scene completely.\n\nHow this happened is quiet remarkable as well. I had read a chicken soup story\nabout a small boy who is asked by his teacher to write an essay about what he wants\nto become. The boy writes his essay describing his dream, of owning a ranch one\nday with thousands of horses. The teacher is not impressed and tells him to alter\nthis unrealistic aim to a more practical one. He tells him to aspire for something\nmore achievable as the boy comes from too poor a background to ever achieve this\ndream. He also threatens to fail him in the assignment if it is not altered. The boy\ncomes the next day and again submits the same assignment. The teacher is furious\nnow. He tells him that he will surely get an F on this assignment. The boy says,\n“You can keep your F Sir and I will keep my dream.” I was very moved by this\nstory. I narrated it to Abhijat and was itching to use it somewhere. For a year, the\nsubconscious thought was to apply this somewhere in the script but we could never\nfind the right moment or place for it. In the end, in a different form, it was used in\nthis scene. I think the thought here is of preserving what defines you. Once you are\nwilling to give that up, then that is the first step towards losing your identity and\nyour dreams. Farhan’s confrontation with his father, apart from writing it, was also\nnot an easy scene to execute. Even in the writing of it, initially, I was not entirely\nsatisfied with the trigger that makes the father come around. I felt maybe Farhan\nhas to say more, do more. Something here was not working for me. Also, I was\nvery unsure about executing the father’s change of heart.",
  "201": "---END OF PREVIOUS SECTION---\nI felt maybe Farhan\nhas to say more, do more. Something here was not working for me. Also, I was\nvery unsure about executing the father’s change of heart. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n The tone, the blocking, the\npitch, everything had to be perfect for this scene to work. I expressed all of this to\n\n339\n\fAbhijat. I was very restless about this. He reassured me and said that he would do\nsomething. He wrote this entire scene on his own and mailed it to me.\n\nWhat clicked was this gesture he suggested for Farhan. The father gets very angry\nduring their conversation and comes and sits down on a chair. Farhan goes up to\nhis father and kneels down before him and talks to him. It was this act of deference\nand total submission that elevated the scene. If you noticed, the tone of the scene\nis not of rebellion but of persuasion. Farhan is asking for permission; he is not\ninforming his parents. He is appealing to them to let him live his dreams. If they\nwould not have come around, he would have sacrificed his dream.\n\nLastly, the scene where Rancho breaks down was not there in the film earlier. If\nyou look at it, there was no need for it technically because after these two scenes\n(Raju’s job interview and Farhan’s conversation with his father), we could have\ngone straight to the barber shaving off Virus’s moustache as he had lost the bet.\nBut I have always felt that when there is an emotion this potent, it has to play\nout in full. You need to see the aftermath, otherwise it appears abrupt. The trick\nto pacing a film is as much in speeding it up as in slowing it down and letting it\nbreathe when the screenplay demands it. I wrote this scene to bring the emotion\nin the earlier scenes to its rightful conclusion.\n\nBut when we shot the scene that in its original form had Raju and Farhan come\nand hug Rancho and he breaks down, I was not satisfied. I called Abhijat and asked\nhim about what he thought of them taking off their pants and saying, “Jahanpanah,\ntussi great ho,” to Rancho. Earlier this was to happen right at the end when they\nreunite in Ladakh. Abhijat liked the idea and we changed it on location. We\nremoved it from the climax of the film and brought it up to this point.",

Tohfa kabool karo.”\n\nThere seems to be a design to the way 3 Idiots has been written. The drama\nis carefully balanced with laughter. The audience does not cave in under the\nweight of any scene. Was this intentional?\n\nRH: This is an inherent trait in all my films. If I had my way, I would package\neverything with laughter. I believe in the world that I create in my films. One\ncan choose to be cynical or one can choose to look at things differently. If you\nreally analyse the emotional, dramatic scenes, you will notice that they incite tears\nof happiness and hope and not of despair and loss except for Joy's suicide. I hate\n\n340\n\fsadness in films. So more than design, this happens because of the way we look at\nthe world: our beliefs, experiences, and ideas.\n\nAJ: I agree with Raju but it is still gratifying to see that after every dramatic scene,\nwe managed to diffuse the tension by making people laugh within minutes. In terms\nof craft, this is a massive challenge. It can ruin a film if not done seamlessly and\neffortlessly. Our inspiration for this was The Lion King. Mufasa’s death is this dark,\nhard-hitting, unforgettable, and memorable moment but exactly two minutes later\nyou are transported to the world of ‘Hakuna Matata’. We shed tears with Simba,\nwe are moved and stirred but two minutes later we are singing “Hakuna Matata’\nwith joy and hope. Most screenplays would dwell on an event like Mufasa’s death\nfor at least ten minutes.\n\nYour (Raju and Abhijat) collaboration began during Lage Raho Munna Bhai.\nIt continued through 3 Idiots and now you are writing another film together.\nIt is a delicate relationship where many things have to come together for it to\nbecome productive. How does it work for both of you?\n\nAJ: Raju and I share the same sensibility. Our approaches, our ideas, the path\nthat we want to take, are all the same.

But\nthe magic of this method is that once you do this, you have, as writers, followed\nsuch an unknown path that the audience has no chance of second guessing the\ntrajectory of the film. So we first follow the magic and pen down what we treasure\nmost and then apply reason and bind it together. It is a rare and wonderful meeting\nof minds.\n\nRH: I spend more time with him than I do with my wife. I wish he were a woman\n(laughs). Apart from him being a good writer and our sensibilities being the same\n(we are both from small towns and we have shared similar experiences; our reference\npoints are the same), the quality I most enjoy and admire in Abhijat is that he does\nnot defend his scenes. Most writers spend a huge chunk of their time defending\ntheir scenes. If I want something done differently, he understands my point of\nview. This does not mean that he is not passionate about what he writes or does\nnot believe in his scene but it simply means that he is ready to explore. He has a\npositive aura. Secondly, I don't have to walk on eggshells with him. That is a huge\nrelief. In cinema, you waste a lot of time, precious time, dealing with egos because\n\n341\n\feveryone you are dealing with is an artist.

Even if the shoot is on and things\nneed to be changed, he has that faith in me and I in him that if it makes the film\nbetter, we will do whatever it takes. This synergy is rare. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n Before Abhijat and I started\nworking together, I never thought that I would need a writing partner or I could\nwork with a writing partner but now I feel it is essential to have one.\n\nThe process of screenwriting and directing holds such mystery that many find it\nhard to figure out where to start. What would your suggestions be to students\naspiring to write and direct their material?\n\nRH: I believe that formal education in some form is essential to an extent. One\ndoes not have to enrol in an institute or course necessarily but other modes of\nlearning like reading, watching theatre and films can help you gather the tools and\ngrammar that will enable you to write and make films. But what is most critical to\npreserve is the faculty to think from your heart. Once you get into theory which is\nimportant, we tend to lose the innocence with which films were watched earlier. We\ntend to view them only with an eye on the craft: there comes the central conflict;\nthose are the hurdles in the plot; lensing just changed; and a crane was used for\nthis shot, and so on, is what we start focussing on. We start viewing films purely\nfrom the perspective of craft. The ability to think from the heart and appreciate a\nfilm honestly vanishes. For me, to keep this faculty to think from the heart alive\nis the biggest battle. This is what leads to honest work. The other thing is to try\nto bring in fresh ideas. It is very tough to do that these days but the effort should\nbe there to achieve this.\n\nAJ: I feel that novelty of idea is paramount. Anything you are writing or attempting\nto write should not have the sound of something that has been done a hundred\ntimes before. The approach that though it has been done before but I will write it\nso well that it will work, according to me, does not work. You need to feel strongly\nabout the idea that you choose and you need to believe in it. It must sound unique\nto you to begin with. Once you have settled on the idea, the element of time comes\nin. A screenplay demands a lot of time and patience. The writing process, in case\n\n342\n\fquality is the goal, cannot be rushed. Therefore, you must be prepared to devote\nthat time. At least two to three years.",

At least two to three years. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n Once these two commitments are made, then\nfor the first two or three months you must not write. You must mull over the idea.\nWhere do I want to go with this thought? What am I trying to say? Who are the\ncharacters in my story? Why is what I am saying worth saying? Why should I be\nwriting this at all? These are the questions you should spend time answering in\nthese initial months. Once you have convincingly answered these for yourself, you\nshould start the writing process. A good technique is to keep two screenplays going\nat the same time. It helps sometimes. You might love some moments but they don’t\nwork for a screenplay so you can always put them in the other one you are working\non or save them for some other story in the future. So you don’t hang on to your\ndarlings. But more than two screenplays at a time is a distraction.\n\nVC: The only process and method I know is consistent, relentless, passionate, and\nfocussed hard work. Let me tell you a secret. Talent, as is the popular belief, is not\ninborn. It is something you have to work for. If you work hard enough, you can\nachieve anything. That is the key to it all.\n\n— Smriti Kiran\n\n343\n\f\fTHINGS OF BEAUTY\n\f\fA thing of beauty is a joy forever ...\n— John Keats\n\nPraise this world to the Angel ... show him\nsome simple thing, refashioned by age after age,\ntill it lives in our hands and eyes as a part of ourselves.\n\n— Rainer Maria Rilke\n\nThree minutes of cinema time ...\n\nA young lady who hates her father’s archenemy and furiously confronts him must\nwithin the next three minutes break off her engagement with her fiancé, fall\nhopelessly in love with the same archenemy, and convincingly fantasise singing a\nrain-drenched love song with him.\n\nThe girl is Pia; the nemesis she must confront is Rancho; the fiancé she must plunk\nis Suhas, the Price Tag; and the song she must sing is “Zoobi Doobi’.\n\nThe question is: How do we achieve this sea change within three minutes of cinema\ntime?\n\nRaju and I ponder over this question in New York City over two cups of tea.",

The question is: How do we achieve this sea change within three minutes of cinema\ntime? Raju and I ponder over this question in New York City over two cups of tea. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n We\nknow with absolute certainty that we can’t spend a single extra minute garnishing\nthe love story. Our screenplay, completed except for this one problem, is already\nhalf-an-hour longer than we would ideally want. And the placement of the love\nsong is particularly precarious: around the 75th minute into the film, a time when\nmost people are itching to leave either for the restroom or for some popcorn. If the\nscreenplay sags even for a second before the song, audiences the world over would\n\fend up using the song as a restroom break. And if they did so, they wouldn't return\nfrom such a mass exodus in time for the interval point, the biggest twist and the\nmost crucial plot-point of the story.\n\nWe can't let them go for a break. Which means Pia must fall in love with her\narchenemy in no time at all. But how?\n\nIn Shakespeare’s Richard III, Princess Anne goes to slay her husband’s murderer\nRichard, only to get engaged to him in the same scene, mesmerised by his\nallure. Richard later boasts: “Was ever a woman in this humor wooed? Was ever a\nwoman in this humor won?” remind Raju of the scene. Raju wryly reminds me that\nwe are not Shakespeare. Point taken. So how do lesser mortals achieve this effect?\n\nThrough some mundane, everyday thing. Some simple object, refashioned age after\nage. In this case, it’s going to be Pia’s watch.\n\nIn their first meeting, Rancho had seen Pia being reprimanded by her brand-obsessed\nfiancé for wearing a cheap watch at her sister’s wedding. When we wrote that scene,\nwe had not seen the potential of the watch as a /eitmotif. Now, in New York City,\nwhere I have followed Raju from Columbus on the last leg of his US trip in the\nhope that we can crack the Pia-Rancho track before his departure to India, we\ndecide to play with the watch and see what happens.\n\nWhat happens is a little miracle that a screenwriter encounters once in about three\nor four years.",

What happens is a little miracle that a screenwriter encounters once in about three\nor four years. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\nOpening salvo with the watch: it helps Rancho deflate Pia’s fiancé with one swift\n‘demo: Rancho hides the expensive watch that the fiancé has just bought for Pia\nand tells him that she has lost it. This simple ruse brings rushing to the fore all the\nmaniacal materialism, brand-obsession, price-consciousness, and the sheer rudeness of\nthe fiancé. Moments later, stunned and insulted, Pia breaks off the engagement.\n\nSalvo two: Rancho has vanquished Pia’s fiancé but not yet won her over. It happens\nin an instant, through a single innocuous remark. He congratulates Pia for showing\nthe courage in breaking off with her fiancé and points out that ‘Ab tum jab chaho\napni maa ki ghadi pehan sakti ho” (Now you are free to wear your mom's watch).\nThis single sentence causes an explosion in Pia’s cognitive universe. In a flash, it\nalters her perception, memory, reasoning, and finally her judgment. How does Rancho\nknow that the cheap watch she was wearing at her sister’s wedding once belonged to her\nmother? Because he could reason that the bride's sister, otherwise dressed opulently,\n\n348\n\fcould be wearing one object so humble only for its sentimental value. Ergo he\npossesses sensitivity and tenderness that she had never suspected he did!\n\nSalvo three: The next time Pia meets Rancho, she holds out her wrist — she is\nwearing her mother’s watch. Without a single word, through the semiotics of that\none gesture, she conveys to him that she has forgiven him his ruthless deconstruction\nand debunking of her father’s and her fiancé’s philosophies, embraced his values and\nis now firmly in his camp. In fact, she loves him.\n\nThus, the watch helps us tide over one of the trickiest plot points that had threatened\nto derail our screenplay.

Even more importantly, it infuses Rancho’s character with\none quality that sets him apart from almost all characters before him in Indian\ncinema — authenticity. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n When Pia’s fiancé is ranting about the astronomical price of\nthe lost limited edition watch, Rancho gently retorts, “Meri to dhai sau ki hai yaar,\nlekin time wohi batati hai” (Mine is inexpensive, but shows the same time). [This\nis an incident that we borrowed almost verbatim from Vidhu Vinod Chopra’ life,\nwhen as a young and struggling student, he could not ignore the slight about his\nhumble watch from an affluent relative.) This remark by Rancho is emblematic of\nhis authentic nature and the very first overt declaration of one of his many priorities:\nvalue over price, passion over pragmatism, excellence over success, understanding\nover information, communication over jargon, education over training, knowledge\nover diploma, and a mother’s watch over a limited-edition watch!\n\nAll we asked of the watch was to save us a few minutes. What it gifted us was the\nkernel, the essence, the very nucleus of the film.\n\nStrangely, we stumbled on the extraordinary potential of objects through a problem\nthat we faced very early in the screenplay, a problem that is every writer’s nightmare:\na big cliché.\n\nThe scene: The Director’s motivational speech to the freshmen on their first day\n\nat college.\n\nAudiences around the world have heard and witnessed such spiel a zillion times,\nranging from the great bombast in Patton and Full Metal Jacket to the lamest\nofferings from the trashiest of campus flicks.\n\nTom Stoppard, the great English playwright, came to the rescue. Not in person,\nbut in spirit — boleto Chetana. Stoppard thrives on introducing bizarre objects into\nhis plays and later providing perfectly plausible explanations for them. One of his\n\n349\n\fplays begins with a man opening the door of his apartment with shaving foam on\nhis face, a bow and an arrow in one hand and a tortoise in the other to find a\npoliceman carrying a bouquet of flowers standing outside. Soon enough, Stoppard\ngives us an entirely convincing reason for this outlandish spectacle.

The Director carries this strange object in his hand as he strides down the imposing\ncorridors. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n The audience wonders about the logic of this peculiar object, till in his\nspeech, the Director links it with competition that abounds in nature: a hoel kills\noff its competition by pushing the host bird’s eggs out of the nest. As the audience\ngets involved in the story of the koe/ and ruthless competition, we have successfully\nnegated a big cliché. Later in the same scene, instead of ending the speech with\nrhetoric or polemics, we take it to its climax with another object: the Director takes\nout a gleaming astronaut’ pen, holds it up enticingly as the ultimate trophy for the\nstudents. Through Rancho’s healthy disrespect for the pen, and his archrival Chatur’s\nsalivating regard for it, we were able to immediately and wordlessly set up the clash\nbetween two conflicting philosophies: obsession with success versus excellence. Once\nagain, an inanimate object was helping us not merely to scale over a plot hurdle\nbut in intensifying the film as a comedy of ideas.\n\nSince one speech was served so ably by two diverse objects, Raju and I intuitively\ngrasped that inanimate objects would play a seminal role in the story. In fact, as\nI have lately grown fond of saying, they would form the DNA of the film.\n\nFor Lage Raho Munna Bhai, we had discovered about halfway through the scripting\nprocess that the DNA of the film was ‘olta kar’ or do the opposite — the principal\nof inversion. For constraints of space, I can only give one quick example of this.\n\n \n\n‘When Munna is asked how to deal with a boy who desecrated Gandhi's statue,\nfrom behind him Bapu answers: “Give more stones to the lad, tell him to topple\nall my statues.” This is clearly inverse to the answer that the audience is likely to\npostulate in their heads and therefore highly intriguing because they cannot second\nguess what will follow. Throughout Lage Raho Munna Bhai, whenever in trouble,\nwe had summoned this principal of inversion.\n\nFor Broken Horses, another screenplay I co-authored with Vinod, the DNA is memory;\nthe childhood memory of a mentally challenged character.

Objects marked the comic and the tragic, the dramatic\nand the philosophical beats of the film with equal felicity. To chronicle the genesis\nof each object that served us so valiantly for transfusing red corpuscles into our\nscenes would fill a book longer than the screenplay. But here is the briefest account\nof our extended encounter with things.\n\nThe Comic Objects\n\nThe empty gift envelopes, the mounds of food on the plates of three friends, and most\ncrucially, the mint chutney are irreplaceable for the comic flavour of the scene where\nRancho gatecrashes Pia’s sister’s wedding. Of these, the mint chutney proved to be\na powerful motif. Rancho first drops it on Suhas’s shoes to determine their price.\nWe went on to use it in three more scenes:\n\nA. In the song ‘Zoobi Doobi’ where Pia imagines Rancho as a chef eulogising\nthe virtues of the “ever-useful mint chutney that, apart from being delicious,\nalso reveals a man’s character.”\n\nB. The scene where a drunken Pia barges into Rancho’s room and he, scrupulously\nsmall town, offers her dhokla with mint chutney to distract her from her\namorous advances. This leads to the memorable lines about the menacing\nnames of innocuous Gujarati food items like dhokla, fafda, thepla that sound\nlike missiles to Pia.\n\nC. The scene of Pia’s wedding, when to stop the groom from heading for the\naltar, Raju Rastogi irons his clothes with an iron drenched in mint chutney.\nAs promised, the chutney reveals the groom’s character instantly as Pia hears\nhim scream out the price of his ruined wedding dress.\n\nOur most innovative comic object, however, is not the mint chutney.

This, by far, is our favourite reel of the film. It\nstarts with the Director’s brutal act of compelling Rastogi to type the letter of his\nown rustication — an act that drives Rastogi into attempting suicide and culminates,\nafter Rastogi’s recovery, in the twin movement of Farhan convincing his father that\n\n351\n\fhe does not want to become an engineer and Rastogi successfully facing a crucial\njob interview. This reel is clearly the heart of 3 Idiots. The problem was that scene\nafter overwhelmingly moving scene, this was also by far the grimmest, darkest, and\nthe longest (about 20 minutes) reel of the film. We desperately needed to bring\nsome levity, some joy to this beat of the story. Since the searing dramatic scenes\nallowed no scope for comic maneuvering, we came up with what I consider to be\nthe most daring and audacious tricks of our screenwriting careers — we decided to\nlace the musical interludes of the song ‘Jaane Nahi Denge Tujhe’ with comedy. But\nhold on! Swanand Kirkere has written those stanzas so movingly and Sonu Nigam\nhas sung them with such unbridled emotionalism that how the hell can we bring\nin comedy into the interludes?\n\nWell, with the help of the little heart-rate monitor.\n\nKnowing that Rastogi’s brain responds to voice despite the coma, Rancho begins to\ntell outrageous and funny lies to him to try and revive him. Though the idea was\ncomic, we realised that it would fall flat since the lies would not elicit a response\nfrom the coma-stricken Rastogi. This is where the heart-rate monitor stepped in.\nWhenever Rastogi responds to anything that is said, his heart rate increases and\nthe graph on the monitor alters.

Life returns to his\nlimbs, hope returns to his friends’ hearts and we, the writers, about to lose our\ncomic licenses for non-use, get a fresh lease of life. Thank you, monitor!\n\nApart from these major objects, there were many minor ones that came fleetingly\ninto the film to help us find chuckles, guffaws, and occasionally, that big explosive\ntheatre-shaking laughter that makes the years of the screenwriter’s toil totally\nworthwhile: the spoon at the end of the rod that Rancho improvises to electrocute\nthe urinating senior; the single grey hair that is kneaded into the flour as the friends\nare eating rotis at the Rastogi house; Chatur’s hand-crafied biscuits from San Francisco\nthat he so jealously guards for Phunsukh Wangdu, the comic device that enabled\nus to weave in the Wangdu track without drawing attention to it; the urn of ashes\nthat the friends so shockingly and irreverently waylay and through the threat of\nimmersing the ashes in the sewer, blackmail the fake Rancho into revealing the secret\n\n352\n\fof the real Rancho being an imposter, thus enabling us to make a long exposition\ndramatic and funny. Pia’s helmet helped us negate the sentimentality and cliché of\nRancho’s dream [“Pia, tum roz dulhan ke costume mein scooter pe baith kar mere\nsapne mein aati ho. Ghoongat ki jagah apna helmet uthaati ho....” (Every night you\nride into my dreams on your scooter, dressed as a bride.

It\nseems to embody the joy and goodwill of the entire campus in its flight. With\nthe crowd beneath giving it rousing cheers, it continues upwards like Shelley's\nSkylark — “Soaring doth thou sing, and singing ever soarest.” Rancho, remote in his\nhand, guides this invention to the window of its originator, Joy Lobo, hoping to\ncatch his astonishment and euphoria on the mounted camera ... and Joy Lobo\nhangs from the ceiling fan, a failure in his own eyes. His most brilliant success,\nthe flying camera, hovers outside his window, recoding the inescapable evidence of\n\nhis flight from this world.\n\nThis is the biggest turning point in the film. From this point on, Rancho, though\nan imposter, living under an alias and hence keen on keeping a low profile, takes\noff his gloves and takes on the system.\n\nI am ashamed to admit that for one full year, for the first five or six drafts of\nthe screenplay, we had something as lame as sleeping pills as the means of Joy’s\ndemise. Peel off a few drafts of the screenplay, and what you stare at is pure\nmediocrity!\n\nA few rings, a wheelchair, a laptop, and a letter, these simple objects provided us\nwith the bulwark for the most important beat of the story in 3 Idiots — the twin\nmovement where Raju Rastogi, a changed man after his suicide attempt, fearlessly\nfaces a job interview and Farhan, unyielding but loving, wins his father’s blessings\nfor leaving engineering and embracing photography. Without the aid of objects,\nthe scenes would have needed so many lines of dialogue to convey the complex\nemotions that they would have degenerated into sermons.

Later, the wheelchair is crucial to the scene when he faces the interview\npanel. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n More than what he has lost, the wheelchair represents what he has gained:\n“Dono taange tudvaake apne pairon pe khada rahena seekha hai” (It took two broken\nlegs to get me up on my feet). The same scene, without changing a single line\nof dialogue, with Rastogi sitting in an ordinary chair would never have had the\nsame impact.\n\nA laptop versus a letter — that is the essence of the encounter between Farhan\nand his father. The letter is Farhan’s dream, written five years ago to his revered\nphotographer requesting apprenticeship but never posted for fear of breaking his\nfather’s heart. Rancho sends it out without Farhan’s knowledge and lo! the photographer\nanswers, inviting Farhan to the Brazilian rainforest to work with him. Now Farhan\nstands at two divergent roads, one that leads him to engineering and the other to\nhis passion, photography. Which one will he take? At this very moment, Farhan’s\nfather is proudly showing his mother the brand new laptop, a gift for Farhan, in\nanticipation of a plush new engineering job. The laptop represents the recompense\nfor all the sacrifices and hardships that the father has undertaken for the education\nof his son and all his solid and conservative hopes of a good life for his son. In\nthis sense, the laptop is the exact opposite of the sense of adventure, uncertainty\nand passion that the letter represents. The scene becomes the battleground for two\ndisparate philosophies through two commonplace objects. When Farhan, without\nan ounce of anger or bitterness, with immense love and respect, makes his father\nsee the validity of his argument, the letter wins. The father tells the mother to\nreturn the laptop and buy a professional camera for his son.\n\nAnother such scene where two rival philosophies clash appears earlier in the film —\nthe scene of the vital bet between Chatur and Rancho. It is a clash not of individuals\nbut of priorities and values: Chatur’s obsession with success versus Rancho’s respect\nfor excellence.

The rivals decide on a date ten years later, when they will meet and\ncompare notes on who won and who lost. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n While there is no overt use of objects in\nthe scene, we achieved the ‘concretisation’ or the ‘solidification’ effect through getting\nChatur to carve out a date on the mossy wall of the terrace. By being engraved on\nthe wall, the date became tangible, solid, permanent. It received an import that it\nlacked when it was merely uttered verbally in earlier drafts. Chatur carves the date\nnot merely on the wall but also on the psyche of the audience.\n\n354\n\fPerhaps the most telling example of this ‘solidification’ or ‘concretisation’ of a scene\nis the interval point of the film. Both Raju and I were extremely proud of our twist:\nafier a long and eventful journey, the friends seem to reach Rancho, but when Farhan\nputs his hand on the man’ shoulder, the man who turns and looks at them is not their\nfriend. It is a complete stranger. The friends are shocked. INTERMISSION. When we\nnarrated this scene to Vinod, he didn’t share our enthusiasm. He was uneasy and\nrestless till he realised what he was missing in the scene. A tangible deepening of\nthe mystery. Vinod felt that without solid evidence of some kind, the audience\nmight take the encounter with the wrong man as some minor misunderstanding,\na communication gaffe that might soon be sorted out. So he added a few extra\nseconds to our scene: Afier meeting the stranger, Farhan sees on the wall, a group photo\nof the classmates, featuring all three friends but the place where Rancho sat in the real\nphoto is now occupied by this total stranger. The wrong man. INTERMISSION. The\ninanimate photo provides the scene with the final turn of the screw. The nebulous\nmystery suddenly becomes concrete. The plot thickens.\n\nAm I reading too much into this concept of ‘solidification’ or ‘concretisation’\nthrough objects? Am I zealously overanalysing a moot point? Are there no major\nscenes in 3 Idiots that do not rely on objects? Wrong.

In fact, the most famous\nscene of the film, Chatur’s speech that goes outrageously wrong [chamatkar versus\nbalatkar, dhan versus sttun] relies entirely on wordplay. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n So does my favorite scene:\nRancho’s deliberately obscure, whimsical, and wooly-headed definition of books\n[“Instruments that record, analyse, summarise, organise, debate and explain information;\nthat are illustrated, non-illustrated, hard-bound, paperback, jacketed, non-jacketed; with\nforeword, introduction, table-of-contents, index; that are intended for the enlightenment,\nunderstanding, enrichment, enhancement and education of the human brain through the\nsensory route of vision. Sometimes touch.”] In both these scenes we relied exclusively\non verbal dexterity. In one instance crude, in the other, sophisticated. Do these\nscenes, then, constitute the antithesis of my argument? Hardly. Because these scenes,\nif anything, serve to demonstrate the devastating effects of the lack of ‘concrete’\nunderstanding and ‘solid’ conceptual clarity that plague our educational system.\nThe wordplay scenes are meant, as Rancho would put it, to be a ‘demo’ of what\nobfuscation, empty jargon, hyperbole, pomposity, rote learning bring upon us —\n\nnothing but ‘balaktkar pe balatkar’.\n\nObjects were our closest allies for three years. Like a friend that you can confidently\ncall up in the middle of the night at the time of a crisis, we knocked on the door of\nobjects every time we were in trouble. Every time, they responded generously. Most\n\n355\n\ftimes, like good friends, they didn’t make a big show of the help they had extended\nand remained largely inconspicuous. Almost invisible. But every object I listed here\nis now a part of what Rogers and Hammerstein have famously described as “a few\nof my favorite things.” Right from the official stamp that seals Farhan’s fate at the\nbeginning of the film, to the astronauts pen that with one signature turns Chatur’s\ngloating victory into a humiliating defeat at the very end of the film, 3 Idiots, could\nnot have been written without dreaming up hundreds of such objects. The most\nmenial of these objects, are for me, things of beauty. They took our hollow scenes\nand filled them with humor or drama; they took our most abstract concepts and\nmade them accessible.\n\nIn Shakepeare’s words, they gave “the airy nothing a local habitation and a name.",

If anything comes as\na close second to the script in his school of filmmaking, it is casting. Every face\nvisible in a Rajkumar Hirani film has been hand-picked by him. “Casting is half\nthe job done as far as characters in the film are concerned. Sometimes, we find the\nright people and at times, the right people find us,” says the man who drives his\nADs (assistant directors) and casting team literally up the wall even for the right\njunior artists meant to provide the ‘background’ in a scene.\n\nTt took Raju a year to freeze on the actor for Joy Lobo’s father in 3 Idiots, a character\nthat appears for barely two minutes on screen. Over five hundred screen tests later,\nhe exclaimed with frustration, “Maybe honest faces are vanishing from this planet.”\nThe brief was to find a face that would be the epitome of selfless love, kindness,\nand innocence. Every heart in the theatre would break when he mourned his son’s\nuntimely death. Raju’s associate, Rajesh Mapuskar, came to the rescue and suggested\nchild actor, Madhav Vaze, from the acclaimed Marathi film Shyamchi Ayee (Shyam’s\nmother) made in 1953. He would be of the right age now to play the role. The\nhunt for the actor began and he was finally located in Pune. The only question\nwas: had Madhav’s face retained the same stirring innocence it had fifty-six years\nago? One look at him and Raju knew he had found Mr. Lobo.\n\nAnd sometimes, the right actor finds his/her way to the right role.",
  "218": "---END OF PREVIOUS SECTION---\nOne look at him and Raju knew he had found Mr. Lobo. And sometimes, the right actor finds his/her way to the right role. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n Every project\ngoes through various stages of casting. A single change in the script could have\n\fone consider someone else rather than the actor initially under consideration for a\nparticular role. If one were to imagine anyone other than Aamir Khan as Rancho,\nKareena Kapoor as Pia, or Sanjay Dutt as Munna Bhai, the entire perception and\ntone of these characters would change in our heads.\n\nThe principal cast of 3 Idiots came together with all the serendipitous twists and\nturns of a commercial potboiler.\n\n@ RANCHO AAMIR KHAN\n\nI never thought of casting Aamir in 3 Idiots. In his case, it is the right man finding\nhis way to the right role. Aamir, in real life, is Rancho.\n— Rajkumar Hirani\n\nWe had actually not thought of Aamir for 3 Idiots. I happened to call him for Rajesh\nMapuskar’s film Ferrari ki Sawari. During that time, we were also in the process of\ncasting for 3 Idiots. Aamir asked me if there was anything that Raju was doing because\nhe was keen to work with him. I immediately called him in for a narration of 3 Idiots.\nAnd just like that, we found Rancho.\n\n— Vidhu Vinod Chopra\n\nIn the twenty-six years that Aamir Khan has spent in the film industry, he and\nVidhu Vinod Chopra have met and spoken about several projects. Vinod had\noffered 1942: A Love Story to Aamir but that fell through. After that, Aamir became\naccustomed to Vinod calling him once every few years and invariably asking for his\ndates for projects that were to begin shooting a month later. Aamir would always\nhear the script but decline because he needed more time to prepare. Moreover, he\nreasoned that if Vinod called him barely a month before the principal photography\nfor a project was to begin, then he was anyway not the man Vinod needed for\n\nthe job.\n\nSo when in late 2007, his phone rang with Vinod’s name flashing on the display\nscreen, Aamir assumed that it was one of Vinod’s regular ‘once-in-four-years’ calls.",

Vinod had managed to stump him yet again.\n\nBut this time things did work out.\n\nYou had expressed a desire to work with Raju. Both of you had even met and\ndiscussed a project. Why did things not work out earlier?\n\nI have very high regard for Raju’s work and for Raju as a person. The first time\nwe met was at the premiere of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. | loved the film and thought\nit was wonderful. A little over six months after that, Raju called me to discuss an\nidea he had for a film. This was before Lage Raho. 1 was travelling then, but we\ndecided to meet the moment I was back in town. After I returned, Raju came to\nmeet me and told me that things had changed. In fact, the morning of the day we\nmet, he decided that the idea he was to share with me, would now be used to do\nthe second innings of Munna Bhai. 1 was still curious to hear of the idea. When\nI heard it, I thought it was a fantastic idea and completely suited the Munna Bhai\ngenre.

So even if\nit is a bad guy in his film, his approach to the character is very warm. In his work,\nthere is a certain joy and simplicity which is what appeals to me and to all of us.\nAlso, Raju is a straightforward person who you take to instantly. He has a basic respect\nand regard for each and every person he deals with, no matter who they are.\n\nAfter the first narration, what was your reaction to the script?\n\nMy first reaction to the script was one of disappointment. It did not work for me\nand if Raju had still wanted to make it the way it was then, I would have had to\n\n361\n\fopt out. I felt sad because I really wanted to work with him. The script had a lot\nof potential but it was not in place as yet. I expressed my reservations to Raju.\nHe heard me out and said that he agreed with quite a few of my points. He told\nme to give him some time and then he came back after about two months. When\nI heard the script the second time round, I liked it. A lot of the issues I had raised\nand he had agreed with, had been addressed.\n\n‘What were the problems that you had with the first version of the script that\nwas narrated to you?\n\nMy basic problem was that Rancho was too heroic in the first draft. He was cocky\nand belting out one smart line after another. I felt he should behave like a normal\nguy. For example, in the introduction scene, initially, he was heroic in the way he\nfaced the guys who were ragging him. It was Rancho’s attitude and not the scene\nthat was a problem for me. The scene has stayed pretty much the same as it had\nbeen earlier. Rancho’s attitude did not make sense to me. A young boy who comes\ninto the first year should be scared when he faces his seniors. He cannot be this\nguy who comes in and churns out smart lines. He came across as too confident\nand too sure of himself. But as I understood him, he seemed to me a guy who is\nnormal. He does not really know how to face guys who are stronger than him and\nare bullying him.",

He does not really know how to face guys who are stronger than him and\nare bullying him. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n That is the reason he runs away and hides in his room.\n\nThe tone initially was of one-upmanship and I felt that Rancho should not really\ncare about that. I wanted him to be scared in the ragging scene and do things out\nof fear and not out of knowing how to handle these tough situations. Similarly,\nin the scene where the Director addresses the first year students and talks to them\nabout the astronaut’s pen, had I said my lines in a cocky manner, then the character\nwould have comes across differently but when the lines are said with a sense of\nexcitement as though the idea has just occurred to the character, and he thinks it\nis a damn good one, so he just says it out loud because he wants to share it, that\ntakes on a different colour altogether. Rancho is enthusiastic about his thoughts\nand shares them spontaneously but he does not know why the others are laughing\nbecause he has not said anything meaning to be funny. Yet, it comes across as a\njoke. Other people find it funny. This is broadly what I had a problem with. It\nwas the crystallisation of the core thought that I was excited about: what the film\nis trying to say — chase excellence and not success — and this is what I wanted\ncoming through in Rancho.\n\n362\n\fYou were not convinced about playing a 20-year-old student in the film. What\nmade you change your mind?\n\nWhen I read the script, I did not feel that Rancho is me because Rancho is a\nnaturally brilliant guy and I don’t see myself as that. Rancho’s philosophy in life\nall along I have been following but as a personality he is a little quirky. I don’t see\nmyself as that. But broadly speaking, how he lives his life is similar to how I live\nmine but when I was reading the script, I didn’t see it that way. Perhaps I don’t see\nmyself that way, so I couldn’t relate myself to him. However, the interesting thing\nthat happened was that I told Raju what I felt: “Though I love the script, how am\nI going to fit this role? I am 43 now and by the time we make the film, I will be\n44 and I have to play a 20-year-old so I don’t think I am the right guy for this\nfilm.",

My fear was that fundamentally\nif people didn’t accept me as a 20-year-old, then the whole film would go for a\ntoss. And that would not be worth it. You are making an entire film. There is too\nmuch hard work involved so why should you let the fate of the film hinge on a\nweak point. Your lead actor is 44 and he is going to play a 20-year-old. Despite\nnot being convinced of it ourselves, if we still went ahead and shot the film, and\nit looked bad, then what were we going to do? This is when Raju spoke to me at\nlength. I think during our interaction leading up to this conversation, Raju had\nbecome increasingly convinced about me playing Rancho. Maybe to start with, he\nwas not totally convinced. I don’t know what was going through his mind but I felt\nthat somewhere along the way, he became surer about me doing the film. Perhaps\nthe interaction helped him in his head as well. The first thing he said was that he\nthought I looked young. Second, he felt that I could pull it off as I have often\npulled off things that people have not expected me to. He gave me the example of\nGhajini. His logic was that if I could pull that off, why not this? I kept countering\nhim by saying that there were limits to what one can do physically. Lastly, he said,\n“Throughout your career, you have been like Rancho. You have taken paths that are\nunconventional. You have not followed any rules. Instead you have broken them.\nYou have chased excellence and success has come after that. When you play Rancho,\nthe audience is going to believe you as opposed to some other actor who has been\nchasing success in reality but spouts these lines on screen. You will bring a lot of\ncredibility to the character and that is why I want you to play it.” This is what his\nopinion was but I kept insisting on finding a younger actor. This discussion went\non. What eventually helped me make up my mind was Raju’s faith in me.",

I instinctively trust Raju\nas a director. I trust his judgement and instinct. I might not be able to see myself\nin a particular way but if the director is able to see me that way, and feel enthused\nand excited about it, then that is important to me.\n\nI am so glad he pushed me. I decided to go with Raju’s judgment. His faith in me,\nmy intense desire to work with him and, of course, what he was making convinced\nme to take on the challenge.\n\nOnce you were convinced and you signed the film, what was your approach\nto Rancho?\n\nI felt Rancho is boyish and transparent. He has a clean heart so most of what he\nthinks and feels is quite evident to people. Had I actually been 20 years old, I might\nhave played the character differently. I don’t know how I would have played it but\nit would have been different. At this age, I had the additional burden of pulling off\nplaying a guy half my age. I had to approach him differently. I had to work on my\nmannerisms and the way I look to cut the age. I was really bulked up for Ghajini\nso I lost a lot of muscle. I tried to look as small as possible in order to look boyish.\nI wore oversized clothes. I had to internalise the mannerisms because if you don’t\ninternalise them, they come out totally fake. In my head, when I was constructing\nhim, I felt he is a guy who is constantly moving. His mind is buzzing. So he seldom\nstays still. He is either scratching his head, shifting from one foot to the other or\nshaking his head. He is quick. There is so much going on in his head that he has a\nlot of buzz in him. That is how I saw him. And because he is transparent, all that\nis going on inside him comes out spontaneously. This trait helped me negotiate the\nsmart lines because the lines are very smart. I felt that if he is so smart, confident, and\ncocky, then he will become a pain in the neck after a point.",

This trait helped me negotiate the\nsmart lines because the lines are very smart. I felt that if he is so smart, confident, and\ncocky, then he will become a pain in the neck after a point. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n To make him likeable,\nthe audience has to feel he is innocent. Let me give you a ‘demo’ (smiles). One of\nmy toughest scenes in the film was when Rancho confronts the Director after Joy's\ndeath. Those are some pretty heavy lines. You might feel those things but to actually\ngo and tell the head of your educational institute all that and to actually provoke\nhim without being asked anything is a rather extreme thing to do. The insinuation\nof Rancho’s words is severe. How does one pull this off? Raju and I even considered\nat one point to have Rancho drunk in this scene but then we did not go down that\nroute. The best way then to go about it, and which is what I did, would be to play\nhim as emotionally overwrought. He is so grief-stricken that he goes and says what\n\n364\n\fhe feels without thinking of the consequences. And the only way to balance the\noutspokenness of the earlier scene would be to show a degree of fear when he is in\nthe Director's office the next morning. He is not taking on the Director or playing\nthis like a challenge. He is making a plea. I am saying a lot of harsh things to the\nDirector and, therefore, I cannot come from a position of arrogance.\n\nBasically, I played Rancho with a different attitude. He is just being plain honest\nbecause he is innocent enough to be honest. He might be scared but he has to\nsay what he feels because that is who he is. The smart lines, I know, needed to be\nretained but as an actor, I had to say them in a way that made them palatable.\n\nFarhan and Raju, as characters, were most likely to have the audience behind\nthem because most people would identify either with Farhan or with Raju.\nRancho is a man you admire but not someone who evokes sympathy or empathy.\nWas this a concern for you?\n\nI was aware of this but it was not a concern for me. One of the problems with\nRancho, speaking from a purely dramatic point of view, is that he has no flaws.\nWhen the character does not have flaws, you may admire the character but you don’t\nemotionally connect with the character because he does not have any problems. He\ndoes not need your help.",

He\ndoes not need your help. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n And he is succeeding in whatever he does, therefore, there\nis no sympathy or empathy for him. As an audience you don’t emotionally invest\nin him. For example, in Taare Zameen Par, your heart goes out to Ishaan because\nyou see the trouble he is going through. You are totally behind him as a viewer. It\nis a very author-backed character. The characters in 3 /diots with the potential of\na strong emotional connect with the audience are Farhan and Raju. These are the\ntwo who have problems. There is a growth in these characters that results in their\ntransformation through the film. In Rancho, there is no growth. He is the same\nfrom the beginning to the end. It was a very big challenge for me to play Rancho\nbecause emotionally he is not author-backed. His only problem is that he loves Pia\nbut cannot marry her. But that is not the main plot. This was another reason it\nwas essential to not make him oversmart. He would have got on everyone’s nerves.\nI warned Raju about this in the beginning that we would have to be careful with\nthis guy or he would be in danger of going overboard. I told him that he would\nhave to be careful as a director and watch out and not let me slip up anywhere.\n\nAnd I think somewhere what works for Rancho is the screenplay because the\nscreenplay really supports him. The story is about two friends who are looking for\n\n365\n\ftheir friend. It is through their intensity, their warmth, and their love for this guy\nthat the audience emotionally connects with Rancho, Whenever I read the script,\nI always cried in Farhan’s scene with his father and Raju’s job interview scene\nbut I never cried for Rancho. I never felt bad for him. It was a task to engage with\nhim emotionally. That came from the bonding and love that Sharman and Maddy\nbrought for Rancho in their performances. The warmth they feel towards Rancho\nseeps through to the audience. Again, at another level, the screenplay is very clever\nbecause throughout the film, you are looking for Rancho and you have only seen\nflashes of him through Farhan’s eyes. We have not met him as yet.",

The emotional high point for Rancho’s character is when he sits around\nwaiting nervously for his friends to return from the situations (Farhan confronts\nhis father and Raju goes for a job interview) they have gone to face, and the\nmoment he realises that they have returned triumphant from these situations, he\n\nbreaks down.\n\nYou were not convinced about Joy’s suicide being in the film for a long time.\nYou opposed it vehemently. Why was that?\n\nAt the script level, I felt that it might not be necessary. The point was coming\nthrough in any case. It is accomplished through Virus’s character as his son had\ncommitted suicide. But the actual reason is a connected thing. If the suicide was\nretained, then the two scenes that came right after it would be very tough to\nnegotiate for me. I was not convinced that people would buy those scenes because,\nlike we just discussed, Rancho is saying some very provocative and harsh things to\nthe Director. See, either the tone of the film is at such a high pitch that saying all\nthis to the Director is alright because the entire film is like that, but we were not\ndoing that. So this worried me. The graveyard scene and the scene after that were\ntough. Right after those is the classroom scene where he is challenging the authority\nof the Director and getting away with it. That line was a very tricky one: “Nahin\nSir, mein aap ko engineering nahin sikha raha, mein to aapko yeh sikha raha tha ke\npadhate kaise hain.” (1 am not teaching you engineering Sir, I am teaching you how\nto teach). I thought the audience would beat us for this. I had to really struggle\nto carry this off. I thought it would be best for Rancho to say this cheekily, pick\nup his bag, and bolt out of there. If I had said these lines in a heroic way or in\n\n366\n\fa manner which suggested that I was taking on the Director, then we would have\nbeen doomed.",

The scene in\nLadakh, the climax of the film, if not shot in the first schedule would have had\nto be shot after a year as Ladakh is only accessible for a few months a year.\nThe decision was made to shoot the climax in Ladakh in the first schedule\nitself. Do you think it would have affected performances had you people shot\nit at the beginning and not a year later which is what you had to do because\nof terrible weather?\n\nI was very relieved that we could not shoot the entire climax then even though\nit was a terrible experience for the entire team. We shot for a day and then bad\nweather hits. It was scary how we evacuated everyone to safety. But all is well that\nends well. Our performances would have suffered because we had not lived those\ncharacters as yet. Especially mine. At least Sharman and Madhavan had shot in\nBengaluru for the first few scenes of the film and, therefore, had forged some sort of\na connect but my first day of shooting for 3 /diots was in Ladakh. I told everyone\nthat I was very happy because it would certainly have compromised the credibility\nwe were able to bring in when we shot for it after shooting for the entire film.\n\nYou actually drank for your drunken scenes. Method acting?\n\nI actually find it difficult to do drunken scenes without drinking. It helps my\nperformance if I actually drink and perform. I believe in aides. My goal is to give\nmy best performance and if anything helps in achieving this, I am happy to use it.\nI am not one of those people who shy away from using things that can enhance\ntheir performance and eventually the film.\n\nWhat do you think is the core of 3 Idiots?\n\nChase excellence and not success is definitely the core thought. To put it differently,\ndo what you believe in and what makes you happy. What makes you happy may\nnot always be conducive to what we commonly understand as success.

Before I could go and talk to\nhim, he came up to me and told me how much he liked my work in Jab We Met.\n\n368\n\fThen he said the magic words: “I am doing a film with Aamir and I might have a\nrole for you.” I jumped and told him that I am game and he does not even have\nto narrate it to me. But Raju insisted that I hear it and then let him know how\nI feel. He was writing at the time and promised to call the moment he was done.\nWhen a month passed by without a word, I messaged him. This time, he asked me\nto wait for a week, and exactly a week later, Raju called and told me that he had\nfinished and I was called in for a narration. I went for the narration with absolute\ncertainty that I would do this film. Nothing was going to change my mind. I heard\nthe script. My first reaction was that this film would create history and I wanted\nto be a part of it. I knew that the film belonged to the ‘3 Idiots’ and my role in\nterms of screen-time would be small but this would be a ground-breaking film\nand only a fool would pass up this opportunity. I have worked in this industry\nfor nearly a decade and this was the most real and evocative screenplay that I had\never heard. Also, it was my chance to work with Raju Hirani. The simplicity and\nromance in his work are unmatched. He does not have to travel to Paris, New\nYork, London, San Francisco, or build opulent sets or drape actors in designer wear\nto create magic. He plays with the magic of moments, of silence, and of life. He\njust moves you and stirs something deep within. I was in and nothing was going\nto change my mind.\n\nWith Raju, you got Aamir as a bonus. It took a decade for you and Aamir to\ncome together. Surely there must have been opportunities before this?\n\nThere had been opportunities before this but nothing worked out.",

There had been opportunities before this but nothing worked out. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n I was supposed\nto do Ghajini but when Murgadoss approached me for Ghajini, I had already signed\nMani Ratnam’s Lajjo with Aamir. Aamir called me and said that he could not do\ntwo back-to-back films with me. I opted out of Ghajini and stayed with Lajjo.\nUnfortunately, Lajjo was shelved. Vishal Bharadwaj was also supposed to do a project\nwith us. Aamir and he had creative differences over the script so that got scrapped\nas well. Basically, every project we were supposed to do didn’t happen. I would often\nbump into Aamir and complain. He kept assuring me and promised that he would\ngive me one of the best films of his career. And today that has happened. It almost\nfeels like a dream. I am in 3 /diots and it is Aamir Khan’s best film ever. He is very\nlucky for the Kapoor sisters. Both, Karisma and I have given super blockbusters with\nhim. I keep teasing Aamir: “You do one film in three years so I don’t know when\nanother heroine will get a chance to work with you. It will probably be my niece\n\nSamaira (laughs).” Aamir is truly a genius. He is a gift to work with.\n\n369\n\fPia is very different from the roles you have done so far. What was your\napproach to Pia?\n\nPia is real. She is spontaneous and outspoken. I have received more accolades for Pia\nthan I did for Geet from Jab We Met. Geet was euphoric, mad, and larger than\nlife. Every girl wanted to be like Geet but Pia’s USP is that she is every girl. She\ntouches a cord across all age groups. I was shooting Kurbaan around the same time\nas I was shooting for 3 Idiots.

Kareena vanished for the time that I was shooting for\n3 Idiots. And Pia has made such an impact that it has left me speechless. I knew\nthis would happen and that is why the length of my role was immaterial. No one\never thought of me as Kareena here. Though I was the only actor in the film who\nwas doing multiple projects at the time, I gave priority to 3 Idiots as it was the\nfirst film I was doing with Raju, Vinod, and Aamir.\n\nAt the time of the narration, I am sure, you must have looked forward to the\nconfrontation between Pia and her father (Virus). That is the one scene that\nbelonged to you. Was that a part of the extensive rehearsals that were held\nbefore the principal photography for the film began?\n\nThis ia my favourite scene in the film. When I heard this scene, I knew that this\nwould be my big opportunity and the centrepiece of my performance. I was determined\nto nail it. I had come fully prepared for it. Raju was very keen that I rehearse this\nscene. I am a spontaneous actress and too much rehearsing does not help me. Raju\nlistened to me which was very nice of him. I requested him to just roll the camera.\nI felt that the entire scene was set up in such a way that the only way to approach\nit was to be spontaneous. The scene begins with Pia clearing the table and you can\nfeel by the way she is putting away the plates and the spoons that she is going to\nexplode. This was done in a single take. I don’t know what got into me but I did\nnot use glycerin. The moment I finished the shot, I expected to hear some kind of\na sound but there was complete silence on the floor. I panicked and thought I had\nmessed up the scene. Raju removed the headphones. He had tears in his eyes and\nthe entire crew gave me a thunderous applause.

I have never ever done a drunken scene\nand I am a teetotaler. This stretched on for fifteen to twenty takes. Drunken\nscenes are not easy to do. It is very tough to get the consistency of drunkness\nand the slurs have to be the same. To make the job at hand tougher, this was a\nsync-sound film. Aamir helped me a lot in that scene. He told me to look at the\ncentre of my forehead so that my eyes look a little crossed. Raju even told me that\nI could drink if that helped me perform. These boys had done a drunken scene\nearlier and they had actually got drunk for it. Aamir kept on telling me to have a\nglass of wine. I told them that this route would not work for me because if I had\nany alcohol I would just fall asleep instantly.\n\nThere were so many takes we did. Finally, Raju asked us to wrap up. I think he\nwas fed up. He said he would manage something in the edit. I was feeling terrible\nthinking maybe I could not deliver as per expectations. But then the film released\nand people went wild about the dhokla-fafada scene. Fans messaged me dialogues\nfrom the scene and I went crazy with the kind of response I got. Raju was aghast\nbecause he had used a ‘No-Good’ take. Normally, actresses in Hindi films don't\nget the opportunity to do a drunken scene and when they do, it is a tough one to\nnail. I am happy that people gave me such an overwhelming response to my first\ndrunken scene.\n\nSaif has worked with Vinod Chopra Films in Parineeta and Eklavya. He knows\neveryone well. Any advice he offered before you took on the film?\n\nDuring the making of Ek/avya, Raju had spoken to Saif about 3 Jdiors but at that\ntime he was still writing.

He was constantly on the sets with me and he saw the film in the office before\nthe first print was out. He was completely floored by it. He kept saying, “What\nhave they made? How are we ever going to surpass this? What have they done?\nEverything will now fall short of 3 /diots.” Even though he had just given a huge\nhit — Love Aajkal — the same year, he is one actor who was genuinely happy for\nour team. He is very close to Vinod, Raju, and Aamir, and was there throughout\nthe making of the film.

He was the only actor I wanted\nfor this role and he did not have a choice but to agree to play Virus. He is a friend\nand I can completely take advantage of that friendship.\n\n— Rajkumar Hirani\n\nRaju and your relationship organically developed into one that went beyond\nfilms. Your interaction on a film is not restricted to just discussing the character\nyou are playing. You are an integral part of his ideas team and long discussions\nrevolving around the script between you and him are an essential part of Raju’s\ncreative process. What was your reaction to the idea and the script of 3 Idiots\nthe first time you heard it?\n\nRaju told me about buying the rights to Five Point Someone when we were in Leeds\nfor IIFA (2007). Raju was there to pick up the best director award for Lage Raho.\nI was very surprised that Raju had bought the rights for this book because my first\nreaction to it was: “What are you going to do with the book?

I had my concerns which we discussed\nover several subsequent sessions but what they had done with it was fantastic.\n\nYou were reluctant to play Virus because you thought it would be in broad\nstrokes a repeat of Asthana from M.B.B.S. Why were you apprehensive about\nVirus and what convinced you?\n\nI was offered this role even by the guy who was planning to make Five Point Someone\nearlier but he could not get the project off the ground. The first time I heard the\ncharacter, I felt Irfan Khan would be very interesting in this role. For me, this\nseemed a lot like Asthana from M.B.B.S. though Raju kept telling me that it is\ndifferent. Eventually, I realised that I didn’t have a choice. I would have to do this.\nT couldn't say no to Raju. Once that was settled, Raju and I got down to working\non the character, fleshing it out and giving it body.\n\nA lot of people felt that Virus was more a caricature than a character. What\ndo you feel about that?\n\n372\n\fVirus comes across as a caricature because, with all due respect, our teachers who\nhave been teaching for many years do become somewhat caricatures of themselves.\nI fed on that. I played that up and that is why he seems caricature-ish. Raju\nand I travelled to Pune for a weekend. While writing 3 Jdiots, they had hired a\nfarmhouse there which was used for writing sessions. For two days we sat and\nworked out Virus.\n\nI wanted this man to be special. I thought of him as dark and edgy with cussedness\nbeing the underlying trait more than anything else. The tone is of sarcasm. He\nhas a mean streak. Then we started padding him up with quirks to embellish his\ncharacter. The idea was also to take Virus away from Asthana as much as possible.\nWe gave Virus this unruly dense crop of hair on his head. Instead of suits he\nwore these ill-fitting clothes belonging to another generation. I borrowed a lot\nfrom people I know in real life.",

I borrowed a lot\nfrom people I know in real life. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n Interestingly, Virus’s daily ritual of the power\nnap whilst listening to opera and getting his shave done is drawn from Mahatma\nGandhi's life. He didn’t listen to opera but he was a very busy man. He had told\nhis staff to cut his nails and shave him whilst he took a nap. This way he saved\ntime. This was our reference point for the quirk we added to Virus’s character.\nThen I wanted him to lisp. For that I had to rehearse for months because if it\ndid not look natural, it could go very wrong. Another of my favourites was that\nVirus has to be ambidextrous. I had called up Abhijat and Raju in America to\ndiscuss this with them. They loved it. Being ambidextrous is a mark of genius and\nmy perception of Virus was that he is a genius. He is not an ordinary guy but\nhe has chosen to devote his life to numbers instead of applying himself to greater\npursuits. The only thing that we changed was his body language. Earlier, I thought\nthat it might be interesting to have a man who constantly speaks about life being\na race and his every habit is geared towards saving time, being laborious and slow\nin his own movements. He walks and moves slowly, but during the rehearsals this\ndid not work at all so we changed it. All this really helped in uplifting Virus as\na character.\n\nThis is your first film with Aamir Khan. He is the protaganist and you are the\nantagonist so to speak in 3 Idiots. What was the experience like?\n\nThis script was narrated to everyone from Hrithik to Shahrukh. I have no idea\nwhy Aamir was not considered but eventually he is the one who did it and was\na perfect fit for the role. He is amazing to work with in all respects — calibre,\n\n373\n\fcommitment, courtesy. The experience of working with him is special.

No special favours extended to me.\n\nHf RAJU RASTOGI: SHARMAN JOSHI\n\nSharman was on my radar since the time my wife, Manjeet, and I had seen his work\nin Style. We had both really liked him and I wanted to work with him whenever the\nright role came along.\n\n— Rajkumar Hirani\n\nSharman Joshi would have frequented the theatres more had he known that\nmovie watching would reap such rich benefits. In early 2007, Sharman got out\nof Globus, a theatre in Bandra (Mumbai) and noticed Raju Hirani with his\nteam in the compound of the cinema hall. Sharman had always wanted to work\nwith Raju. Though tempted to walk up to him and introduce himself, Sharman\nhesitated thinking that this might not be the right place to approach him. But he\nwas pleasantly surprised when on spotting him, Raju smiled and waved at him.\nConfidence boosted, Sharman walked up to him.\n\nBut bigger surprises were in store for Sharman that night. Raju told him that he\nhad a role for him but since he was still in the process of writing, he would get\nin touch with him soon.\n\nSharman went home in a daze.\nHow did 3 Idiots come together for you? I believe that the restrooms at various\nmultiplexes have played an important role?\n\n(Smiles) The first time Raju Sir told me he had a role for me was at a chance\nmeeting in the compound of a cinema hall. Though I did not get a call from him\nfor a few months, after that I knew that the offer was for real. The very first time\n\n374\n\fyou meet Raju Sir, you can feel the honesty and sincerity.

We met in the restroom after the film was over. We\nstood there chatting for 15 minutes. Again, a few months passed by. Uncannily, we\nbumped into each other in the restroom of the same multiplex yet again but this\ntime during the interval. Raju and I joked that slowly we were inching towards the\nbeginning of the film. Three chance meetings at cinema halls are rather weird.\n\nFinally, we connected and I went and met him at his office. The first meeting was\nsupposed to be a casual one but I think Raju was so excited and happy that he\nnarrated the entire script to me. This would be approximately six months after our\nfirst meeting in the compound of a cinema hall.\n\nShahrukh was doing the film at the time when I was signed on. Then there was\nan eight-month break where Shahrukh was not doing the film and eventually\nAamir came in. Once Aamir came in, I was constantly in touch with Raju but\nduring the in-between period, I did not bother him at all. That’s how this whole\nthing happened.\n\nWhat was your first reaction to the script?\n\nI loved the script and even though they still had to make the final decision about\nme, I went out that night and celebrated. I didn’t even know which character I\nwould play — Farhan or Raju — if I was doing the film. I honestly loved both\ncharacters so it would not have mattered to me which one I would play. Initially,\nShahrukh was playing Rancho but later Aamir came in, and once he did, I auditioned\nfor both the parts. I had read Five Point Someone so for the first script narration\nI had come with some pre-conceived notions about the different roles in the film.\nFor example, in the book, Alok’s character is rather weak. I was a little worried\nabout that. But once the script was narrated to me, the character was completely\ndifferent and was not weak.

What is beautiful about working with Raju is that for every\nlittle change, Raju involves everyone. His humility is on a different level and he\ntruly and honestly respects every individual. I was pleasantly surprised that Raju\ngave me a pen and pad and asked me to jot down what I felt about the film and\n\n375\n\fif I had any inputs, these could be discussed. He likes participation, and, most\nimportantly, that participation is truly appreciated.\n\nI auditioned for the role with the scene in the Director's office after we were\ncaught gate-crashing his daughter Mona’s wedding. It is the one with “Sir aapki\nper plate cost kya thi”. At that time, Madhavan was not there so I had auditioned\nwith another actor.\n\nI was drawn to the script because it is about finding yourself. The scenes where\nFarhan confronts his father and his job interview are the core of the film. I loved\nthe human element in the film and the journey of these two friends who find\nthemselves through various experiences.\n\nYou said that you auditioned for both Raju and Farhan? Did you seriously\nlike both the roles equally?\n\nRaju Sir being Raju Sir gave me the option of auditioning for whichever role\nI wanted to play. This he did in the first meeting itself. Like I said, I had gone\nthere with pre-conceived notions so I had my apprehensions. I told him what\nI felt about Alok’s character. He just smiled and narrated the script to me. After\nthe narration, he asked me the same question. My answer this time round was\nwhichever one he would like me to audition for. I had understood that both the\ncharacters were solid. He made me audition for Raju. Then, after a few weeks, he\nmade me audition for Farhan.\n\nEventually, he made me play Raju’s character. Frankly, this film is so well etched out\nthat I really didn’t have to do much. This script is remarkable and equally remarkable\nis the way it has been executed.

The other scene was the scene with my father in the film\nwhere I tell him that I don’t want to pursue engineering. Raju was not going to take\na decision right then even though I could see that he was convinced. He said that\nhe would let me know. I did not hear from him for two weeks. Then I received a\nmail from him saying that Vinod Chopra would call me. This was somewhere in\nApril 2008 and we were supposed to shoot in August. After waiting for some more\ntime, I called Raju and asked him if I could give my dates away as I had not heard\nfrom them and my other producers were waiting. Raju was shocked to hear this\nand said that I absolutely couldn't give away my dates because we were shooting\nin July. Apparently there was some confusion and I had not been informed. Then\nVinod called and things were finalised.\n\nDid you audition for both the roles or was it always Farhan?\n\nFarhan was the only role I related to when I heard the script. I think even Raju had\nonly Farhan in mind as far as I was concerned. When Raju narrated the script to me,\nI knew that every student and every father in the country would relate to Farhan.\nIf I was able to pull this role off, then that would be my biggest achievement.\n\nWhat were your first reactions to the script?\n\nThe best part about Raju is that he encourages us to think like the characters we\nare to play. Our feedback is considered and taken very seriously. As an example,\nfor a long time, I felt that I did not have enough of a trigger to go confront my\nfather. Initially, the letter to Andre Istevan was not there in the script. I spoke to\nRaju several times about this. Two or three weeks later, Raju told me about the\nidea of the letter to Andre Istevan that Farhan never posted, and that became\nthe trigger. I did not even know that Raju had taken my apprehension seriously\n\n379\n\fand had been working on it.",

I did not even know that Raju had taken my apprehension seriously\n\n379\n\fand had been working on it. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n Raju came up with this idea and then he and Abhijat\nplanted the fact that I am an animal lover with a natural talent and interest in\n\nwildlife photography.\n\nThe film started its principal photography with your scene in the airplane.\n‘What was your approach to Farhan as he is also the narrator of the film?\n\nThe first transformation you see on screen is in Farhan. So there was the additional\nchallenge of making that believable. If the audience did not find me convincing,\nthen it would set the wrong tone for the film. I set about working on my look first.\nAlso as a character, I go through maximum transformation. Raju’s transformation\nhappens in college after his suicide attempt. He loses his fears and there is a complete\nchange in his attitude evident in the interview scene but Farhan’s transformation\nin terms of his personality was to happen once he left college. There had to be a\nmarked difference between the Farhan the audience would see in the first scene\nand the one they would see in college. I gave myself a darker, leaner, and rugged\nlook for the portions in the present. I am a wildlife photographer and, therefore,\nspend time in the sun, wear those jackets with many pockets to hold things that\ncome in handy on a shoot and name an edgier personality. There is an aggressive\ndimension to Farhan, the wildlife photographer. But as an engineering student, he\nis mild and innocent. I went completely clean shaven, chubby cheeked with round\nboyish glasses. It took us a very long time to zero in on the glasses, I remember.\nSo, I worked on the look as well as the personality to make sure that the journey\nof the character is evident and real.\n\nHf CHATUR RAMALINGAM: OMI VAIDYA\n\nWe took a huge gamble by casting Omi. He has a long and important role in the film\nand we were casting someone for it who did not know Hindi at all. It was a huge\nchance we took which paid off eventually. Omi is a great find. He brought credibility\n\nand believability to Chatur’ character which was critical for it to work.\n\n— Rajkumar Hirani\n\nHis feet were killing him.",

A lot of people from the Marathi community in America had flown in to\nattend the event. Finally, the night was winding down and it was time to let go\nand have some fun. He hit the dance floor and inadvertently started dancing with\n\n380\n\fa girl. She was a screenwriter from Michigan and he, a working actor and film\ndirector. They exchanged numbers.\n\nFour years later, the actor-director while on a visit to India to find possible buyers\nfor his film, got a call from her — out of the blue. Supriya Kelkar, the screenwriter\nfrom Michigan was now working with Vinod Chopra on Broken Horses and wanted\nto give Omi Vaidya a heads-up on a possible role in their production 3 Idiots.\n\nOmi Vaidya might never have bagged this career-altering role were it not for that\nrandom dance four years ago at a Marathi night in Los Angeles.\n\nYou have lived in America all your life and are a working actor in LA. Was\nHindi Cinema on your agenda?\n\nBoth my parents were very supportive of my choice to pursue acting, otherwise\nit would have been very difficult to do this. Most Indians settled abroad might\nnot have managed to do what I did. I had my family backing me and that is\nthe reason it was possible. My mother had wanted to become an actress but she\ncould never pursue that desire so she made sure that at least I could follow my\ndreams. Therefore, I did not have to worry about things like rent and food after\ncollege and was able to concentrate only on acting. Bollywood, strangely, was never\non the radar nor was the sensibility preferred or familiar. I did not know much\nabout Bollywood films. I had seen some of Aamir Khan's films. But three-hour-\nlong films with all the dancing made little sense to me and the sensibility did not\nhold much appeal for me either. I had seen a bit of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. but\nnothing of Lage Raho. All of this, I later realised, was actually a boon. It was an\nasset to have little knowledge of Bollywood.",

I could perform\nwithout being hampered.\n\nHow did 3 Idiots happen and what drew you to the material despite no prior\nplans or inclination to be part of Hindi Cinema?\n\nWhen I got a call from Supriya, I sent my showreel across and Raju liked it because\nhe felt that I was very boyish and, most importantly, I was not from India. Initially,\nI was very sceptical. I informed them that I didn’t speak the language at all so\nhow would this be feasible. The people scheduled to audition me just refused to\nlisten assuming that I would at least have some knowledge of the language because\n\n381\n\feverybody who says they don’t know the language, do know a little bit. Little did\nthey know that I really did not know the language at all.\n\nI was auditioned on Raju Rastogi’s lines from the film and I was terrible. I spent\nsome three hours in the office reading the material. During the screen test, 30 seconds\nafter I started saying the lines, the casting director started correcting me and a\nminute into the audition, she asked me to stop. I was politely thanked so I knew\nthat they had not been impressed but then I had gone in knowing that I would\nfail, What worked in my favour was that Raju came into the office while I was\nmeeting his team. He had some work there so I ran into him. We got to chat a\nbit and therefore a personal connection was established.\n\nA few days later, I received a call from the team asking me to come in again. And\nthis time, they said that they would send me a script for the audition. They sent me\na portion from Munna Bhai. The brief was that I would have to learn the lines and\nnot speak them. I was not to worry about speaking Hindi correctly: the character\nwas an NRI though he had not been fully fleshed out as yet but I was just to do\nwhat Omi would do. I felt much more comfortable with this.",

So I did gestures that were absolutely not in\nsyne with what I was saying. They liked this a lot. After this test, the brief for the\ncharacter expanded a little bit. I was told that the character is a top honcho of a\ncorporate concern, always in a suit with a whole lot of expensive and fancy stuff.\nHe has come back to India to prove a point to these guys who used to make fun\nof him. This was what I was given to play with. I was asked again not to worry\nabout the Hindi. If I so wanted, then I could do it all in English. So I did this\ntest even better. I smoked a ciggarette and did my thing. All the Hindi words that\nI knew were the bad words so I sprinkled what I was saying with that. My mother\nwas there with me so she was a bit shocked.\n\nI did the audition well but I was quite sure that I was not right for the role because I\ndid not speak the language at all. I went back to LA after this test and did not\nhear from the 3 /diots team for a month. In LA, if you don’t get a call for a week\nafter an audition, it can be safely assumed that you didn’t get the job.\n\nBut a month later, I got a call from the production team and this time I was told\nthat I would be auditioning with scenes from 3 Idiots. I knew then that I was in\nthe race and, therefore, being seriously considered. Then I started studying the text.\nThey gave me the now famous balatkar speech scene. The other scene they gave\n\n382\n\fme was the water tank scene where I lose my temper and the bet between Rancho\nand Chatur is made. I could see that they wanted to gauge whether I could do\nboth comedy and drama. The Broken Horses team was in New Mexico so I flew\nto New Mexico and did the audition. I gave it my best shot.

He was right because my mom had taught me. He told me to stop learning\nHindi as this character would know very little Hindi. They were writing him like\nthat, therefore, if I wanted the role, I would have to stop learning Hindi and stop\nwatching Hindi movies. He did not want my interpretation of the character and\nperformance to be affected by such factors.\n\nThings work differently here than in the West. Did you have any apprehensions\nabout being away from the Hollywood scene for the considerable duration\n3 Idiots demanded you to be away?\n\nI had my doubts because I was giving up six months of my life and not being paid\nmuch according to Hollywood standards. I worried about whether this was the right\nchoice or not. But the very reason I chose this as my preferred field of work was\nbecause I wanted to be able to do new, fun, and exciting things. This would offer\nall the things I looked for in a job. It was a new system and sensibility I would\nbe operating in. Therefore, I wanted to do this and it was my choice. Also Raju’s\nsincerity and personal emails to me convinced me that I would be taken care of.\nOnce I came down here and saw the level of professional courtesy I was extended,\nthe sincerity and the seriousness, I knew I had taken the right decision.\n\nWhat were your first reactions to the script?\n\nThat it is a very long one (laughs). There were lots of pages. I read through it\nbut I kept my focus on Chatur. I had not thought of the film as a whole. I only\nfocussed on my character. When I saw the full film, that is when I realised what\nthe whole film was all about. I really just kept my mind on Chatur. Also my lack\nof knowledge of the language kept me from understanding a lot of things.\n\nYou were already dealing with language issues.

The anger and depression had to be worked on. I had a three-\nday break before we were to shoot this scene. I requested Raju to let me leave the\nproduction for those three days and to just put me up in a small room or club\nor hotel somewhere away from everyone. Raju agreed and I isolated myself. When\nI reached the set three days later, I kept to myself and let the isolation gnaw at me.\nRaju loved my work in that scene. It took me another three days after the scene\nto come out of the state I had driven myself into though.\n\n‘What was the experience like for you since this is your first brush with Hindi\nCinema?\n\nThe whole experience was very different from America. It was very interesting.\nI really wanted to do this and I am glad I did. This was primarily because I knew\nthat Raju wanted me and it is very rare and different from America where whether\nthe director wants you or does not want you does not matter because the corporate\nguys make the decision. Here, the director really liked me and wanted me and\nwe had developed a personal connection. Systems-wise, things were completely\ndifferent from the West. Here make-up and costume trials were done in your hotel\nroom which was a little odd. I got the script five days before we began shooting.\nThough it took some getting used to, all of this had its own flavour. Also, I am\nnot from here so I don’t really have hang ups about chatting and mixing around\nwith the drivers and kitchen staff. So I could absorb a lot and get in touch with\nthe ground realities a lot better as I chatted with these people. These guys have\nthe most interesting stories. The others are more politically correct and talk about\nshow business all the time.
