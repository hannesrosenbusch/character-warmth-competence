Then a black and white New Orleans Jazz Funeral\n\n          procession passes in front of him - black and white in the\n\n          sense everyone in it and all their instruments and lively\n\n          waving umbrellas are in black and white.

DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - LATER\n\n                         \n\n           it's important to note that the source footage for most of\n\n          what follows is the actual hand-held video captures of the\n\n          cop-baiting Rage Against the Machine daytime concert staged\n\n          among five city blocks outside the Democratic National\n\n          Convention in Los Angeles. Five thousand angry, anti-\n\n          establishment young people - 2,000 police officers wearing\n\n          riot gear, as well as additional horses, motorcycles, squad\n\n          cars and police helicopters, all captured in raw frames\n\n          Walter has been very naturally included in. He's trying to\n\n          walk through the crowd, find his way home through it (this is\n\n          the free provocative downtown concert the reporter mentioned)\n\n          but he's being recognized.\n\n                         \n\n                                             KID\n\n                    It's I'm a Man Man.\n\n                         \n\n          Walter's trying to find his Danish friends.\n\n                         \n\n                                             WALTER\n\n                    Ulf?\n\n                                                                     106.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          Walter's being rubbed on the head by way of congratulations,\n\n          recognized from what he did earlier.

Then there's face to face, cop-\n\n          protestor taunting. There are five thousand young people in\n\n          the street (and Walter) and they're too close to the sedans\n\n          that drove the business leaders there.

It's really good. You can see\n\n          the word LIFE on the building sign above the bench. So the\n\n          last photograph, on the last cover of Life, elegantly honors\n\n          the people who quietly worked there and cared for it.\n\n                         \n\n          Walter stands in front of the newsstand looking at it.
