The text \n\n               printed here attempts something that is still rare in the \n\n               publication of screenplays and scripts. Usually these are \n\n               transcripts of what finally appeared on screen, based either \n\n               on the approved release script or simply on a description of \n\n               the dialogue and action. Occasionally an 'original' script \n\n               is published, although this is more common in cases where \n\n               that script has not been filmed and is therefore offered as \n\n               'literature'. The inevitable differences between script and \n\n               finished film are due to many factors, some creative, others \n\n               practical and circumstantial. A comparison of the original \n\n               and the result would therefore often be of little interest, \n\n               without a lengthy commentary on the production itself. In a \n\n               few cases, however, script and film remain relatively close \n\n               and the reasons for variation are interesting and \n\n               comprehensible. The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp is one \n\n               such case. There is only one known 'full script' version, \n\n               entitled The Life and Death of Sugar Candy' (clearly dating \n\n               from some time in June 1942. when it was hoped this concession \n\n               would win War Office approval).",

What makes it \n\n               specially valuable is that it goes well beyond mere dialogue \n\n               and action, often describing location, character and \n\n               atmosphere in a highly suggestive way. Hence the decision to \n\n               present this script as written, together with a notation of \n\n               the film as it appears today. The system used is similar to \n\n               that devised by Bambi Ballard for her edition of Abel Gance's \n\n               script of Napoleon. This involves using double square brackets \n\n               [[ ]] to enclose original script material which does not \n\n               appear in the final film, and single square brackets [ ] for \n\n               material added during production. This means that in some \n\n               cases two variants of essentially the same speech appear \n\n               consecutively, which is not ideal, but hopefully the chance \n\n               to compare versions and trace shifts will compensate for any \n\n               local irritation. Names and titles which were changed in \n\n               production (such as Mullins to Murdoch, Colonel to General, \n\n               Die Walkure to Mignon) are given in their final form after \n\n               the first indication of a change.\n\n\n\n               What of the film 'text' itself? This was originally released \n\n               in July 1943, running for 163 minutes. By the early 70s, the \n\n               only known versions of comparable length were two original \n\n               nitrate copies held by the British Film Institute Deposit \n\n               Print Collection and screened occasionally at the National \n\n               Film Theatre.* All other copies appeared to be, at most, \n\n               between 130 and 140 minutes. The Radio Times, billing the \n\n               first UK television transmission on Boxing Day 1972, quoted \n\n               BBC sources: 'this is the longest version we could find. But \n\n               rumour hath it the original ran over three hours!' The slot \n\n               allocated indicates an anticipated length of about 130 \n\n               minutes.\n\n\n\n               * One of these was donated by Powell and the other by Rank, \n\n               apparently in the late 50s.

These are \n\n               the questions which still lack definitive answers, but some \n\n               reliable evidence and explanation can now be given. The US \n\n               Motion Picture Almanac lists Blimp for three consecutive \n\n               years, from 1944-45 to 1946-47, as belonging to 'Archers-\n\n               General' and at its original length of 163 minutes.* \n\n               Correspondence in the Powell papers indicates that there was \n\n               considerable speculation about how to release it in the United \n\n               States; but despite the pleas of specialist independent dis-\n\n               tributors, it was eventually assigned to United Artists under \n\n               Rank's overall deal with that company, and released by it in \n\n               May 1945. The running time listed in the Motion Picture Herald \n\n               review of 24 March 1945 was 148 minutes and the title is \n\n               given as Colonel Blimp. Four years later, Blimp resurfaced \n\n               in the trade press with a report that Rank had initiated \n\n               action by the Federal Trade Commission to restrain UA from \n\n               showing a version of 91 minutes, cut from the 'original' of \n\n               143 minutes. + The outcome, it was stressed, was academic, \n\n               since the film 'had been out of circulation for over a year'. \n\n               By the early 50s, it appears that either the US version had \n\n               become the only one available in Britain, or that the film \n\n               had been further shortened - possibly in order to fit into a \n\n               double-bill. Running times of 140 and 120 minutes have been \n\n               quoted by various sources. All of these shortened versions \n\n               (if there was more than one) seem to have had the Prologue \n\n               removed, so that the action started in 1902 and moved forward \n\n               to the Turkish Bath in 1942-43.  This, at any rate, was the \n\n               version that I first saw in a nitrate print in 1971, but \n\n               unfortunately did not time.\n\n\n\n               In 1976, the BFI Deposit Collection was handed over to the \n\n               National Film Archive, which took the opportunity to \n\n               'cannibalize' the three prints it now held, making a nitrate \n\n               viewing copy of some 160 minutes.",

A first phase of restoration then started, \n\n               with support from the BBC, to make a printable safety \n\n               negative, based on the original Technicolor separations. The \n\n               result was unsatisfactory technically, but capable of being \n\n               enhanced electronically for a TV transmission on 11 October \n\n               1980, billed as allowing the film to be 'seen tonight on \n\n               television for the first time in its full original version'.\n\n\n\n               Work continued at the NFA, supervised by Paul de Burgh and \n\n               with help from the Rank Film Laboratories and a grant from \n\n               the Sainsbury Charitable Trust, which resulted in a new safety \n\n               negative. This provided the basis of a reissue of the film \n\n               by BFI Distribution in 1985, after a Gala Screening at the \n\n               Screen on the Hill on 18 July, attended by Powell and \n\n               Pressburger. It has been used as the basis for annotating \n\n               the original script.\n\n\n\n               * Rank's original distributor, General, still existed in the \n\n               US; and The Archers seem also to have been active in trying \n\n               to place their film.

It has two floors, \n\n               an upper and a lower, connected by a wide shallow staircase \n\n               covered with red carpet. The time is about 9 p.m. and people \n\n               are crowding in through the wide doors from the wintry street \n\n               outside. It is still snowing. The Porter outside carries a \n\n               huge, open umbrella.\n\n\n\n               The Patrons of the Cafe are mostly from the middle class and \n\n               upwards. Students are there in their coloured caps (each \n\n               student organization has a different cap), artists, officers, \n\n               one or two parties of society people, ordinary townspeople \n\n               with their families  all sorts. They eat and drink; glasses \n\n               of hot punch and mugs of beer are the favourites and there \n\n               is a great bustle everywhere.\n\n\n\n               On the upper floor, where the landing makes a big bay, there \n\n               is an orchestra. Their standard of playing is quite high. \n\n               The orchestra consists of a piano, a drum, a double-bass, a \n\n               cello, a flute, a clarinet, two violas and four violins; \n\n               and, of course, a conductor.

We can claim, of course, the pink \n\n               >odies of the General's Staff in the Turkish Baths and the \n\n               General's Red Tabs, but these, however attractive, are \n\n               decorations. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n Sights, sounds, but above all, colours, make up \n\n               the memories of a generation: more so in the case of the \n\n               period with which we have dealt. 1902 was the commencement \n\n               of the Edwardian era, full of charm, prosperity, spaciousness \n\n               and leisure, to which it seemed there could never be an end. \n\n               Our next use of colour is in the first part of the 19181919 \n\n               Sequence which we call for convenience, the 'Khaki Sequence'. \n\n               After four years of senseless trench warfare, all the colour \n\n               and variety of Europe and its peoples had been reduced to a \n\n               uniform dull colour by day and to blackness by night. Khaki \n\n               was the colour of clothes, faces, official forms, everything: \n\n               while the battle zone itself had been reduced to a consistency \n\n               as featureless and as sticky as porridge. By this deliberate \n\n               elimination of all colours except Khaki, we hope to point \n\n               this contrast.\n\n\n\n                                       SEQUENCE 52.\n\n\n\n                             Exterior: Somewhere in Flanders\n\n\n\n               A CROSS-ROAD\n\n\n\n               It is dusk. It is not raining but it has been and it will \n\n               again.  An Army staff car, 1918 vintage, is approaching along \n\n               the road, once a pleasant avenue, now a dreary, cratered \n\n               embankment lined with splintered stumps.\n\n\n\n               The continuous thunder of heavy guns sounds in the far \n\n               distance.  The car bumps to a stop at the cross-roads.  On \n\n               the back seat sits COLONEL (Acting Brigadier} CLIVE CANDY. \n\n               He is now a man of forty-two, many ribbons on his chest. His \n\n               moustache is heavy but well cared for, he looks tired but \n\n               full of energy and devotion to serve his country. He has a \n\n               map spread out on the seat beside him.\n\n\n\n               His driver, [[MULLINS]] [MURDOCH], is also his batman. He is \n\n               about the GENERAL'S age; out since Mons.\n\n\n\n               The landscape, the sky, the car, the men and their mud-\n\n               plastered uniforms are all one pervasive scheme of khaki. \n\n               The only Spots, of colour are the GENERAL'S Red Tabs.",

There is a \n\n               Guard House on the island and the bridge is heavily wired \n\n               with barbed wire above and below and English sentries are \n\n               stationed on the bridge.\n\n\n\n               The prisoners sit on benches or on the grass, many are \n\n               standing, all are listening intently to the music.
