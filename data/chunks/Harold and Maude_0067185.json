A young man enters but we\nsee only his shoes and the cuffs of his pants. We TRACK\nwith him as he walks across the room and stops at a record\nplayer. Pause. We HEAR a record drop and begin playing\n\na light classical melody. The SUPERIMPOSED TITLES BEGIN.\nAfter a moment the feet move off and we TRACK with them,\npast a low table, and around a couch to the window curtains.\nThe feet pause there for a moment. A piece of heavy\nwindow cord drops INTO FRAME. We FOLLOW as it is dragged\nalong to the low table. Then the feet move over to a large\nornate desk. The cord is pulled up OUT OF FRAME. Pause.\nThe feet walk over to a chair by the wall. It is picked\nup, carried to the center of the room, and carefully\nplaced. Pause. The feet get up onto the chair and the\nCAMERA RISES to their level. They shuffle about for a\nmoment. At an appropriate musical break the CREDITS STOP.\nSuddenly the feet knock over the chair and drop into\nspace. They kick about for a bit, then go slack and still.\nThe FINAL CREDITS are SUPERED OVER the suspended appendages\nwhile the music comes to a lilting conclusion. As we HEAR\nthe record player turn itself off, the CAMERA BEGINS a\nhalf circle tour around the hanging feet and stops at the\nheels. Pause. Outside we HEAR a woman's footsteps\napproaching and we change focus as the door to the den\nopens. Through the blurred hanging feet we see a tall,\nmiddle-aged, fashionably dressed woman enter and we PAN\nwith her as she walks to the desk. This is MRS. CHASEN.\nShe seems rather tired and preoccupied as she begins to\nremove her long white gloves. Slowly the CAMERA BEGINS a\nvertical rise up the side of the hanging corpse until we\nare watching Mrs. Chasen over his left shoulder.
