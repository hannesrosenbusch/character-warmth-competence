This was around the time that\nthe Bernie Madoff scandal broke and it was everywhere. | finished the first draft in two\nweeks and six months later we were shooting.\n\n| constantly read scripts online and thought it was only fair to “pay it forward” by posting\nmy own script as well. It was my first produced feature screenplay and although I’ve\nimproved as a writer since then, I’m still very proud that we got this made.
