NEW TOWN HALL - LATER\n\n\n\n           The sky has lost its lurid pall, and the clouds are now\n\n           lighter and less menacing.\n\n           In the Town Square, clusters of townsfolk are trying to\n\n           come to terms with the night's events.\n\n           Norman weaves through the crowd away from the Babcock's\n\n           station wagon, searching for Neil. He hears small\n\n           snippets of conversation as he goes.\n\n           Dwayne waves his notebook under Hooper's nose.\n\n\n\n                          DEPUTY DWAYNE\n\n           So, uh, are we gonna need\n\n           statements?\n\n           She slaps it out of his hand.\n\n\n\n           DEPUTY DWAYNE (CONT'D)\n\n           Ow! That was my finger nail.\n\n           Slob Guy, Crystal and Mrs Henscher are convincing each\n\n           other of their excuses.\n\n\n\n                          MRS HENSCHER\n\n           You know what it's like.

They\n\n           pushed me into it.\n\n           Norman smiles as he passes Alvin, regaling a bunch of\n\n           teenagers.\n\n\n\n                          ALVIN\n\n           Yeah, me and Norman are in a lot\n\n           of the same classes.
