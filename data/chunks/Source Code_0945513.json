The capsule is\n\n          incredibly cramped.\n\n          Rifling through a cabinet, he discovers OPERATIONAL MANUALS\n\n          in small, almost illegible type. And a small set of TOOLS.\n\n          He spreads them out on the tiny ledge. Taking a wrench, he\n\n          BANGS on the escape hatch. A deep, clanging ECHO in the\n\n          hull.\n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n          44.\n\n          So, like any pilot would, he sets about repairing his craft.\n\n          At first he puzzles over the electronics and circuitry.\n\n          Daunted by the complexity.\n\n          There's no time to lose. Using a miniature screw driver, he\n\n          begins unscrewing the monitor panel. His fingers are slow\n\n          and clumsy in the frigid cold and the screw driver slips out\n\n          of his hands.\n\n\n\n                         LATER\n\n          Icicles have appeared over dormant air vents. Colter, ice\n\n          crystals in his hair, is shivering more violently. Much of\n\n          the capsule's electronics lay open and exposed.\n\n          Using copper wires, he's attempting to revive a row of\n\n          BATTERIES. They spark once... twice... Nothing.\n\n\n\n                         COLTER\n\n          Come on!\n\n          Another SPARK. It shocks him. There's a puff of blue smoke.\n\n          He's burned his fingers.\n\n          But the battery now has a tiny BLINKING GREEN LIGHT.\n\n          Working fast, Colter attaches the copper wires to the leads\n\n          on the battery. From inside the engines comes a faint\n\n          electric HUM.\n\n          FFFT. The monitor awakens. Like a film projector it throws\n\n          the image of a PLAYING CARD onto the opposite side of the\n\n          craft.\n\n          Colter begins replacing the monitor components. As he does,\n\n          a pre-recorded AUDIO FILE comes on:\n\n\n\n          GOODWIN (V.O.)\n\n          -- four principle dialects of\n\n          Arabic: Egyptian, Gulf, Syrian-\n\n          Lebanese and North African.
