His neck is snapped, head\n\n          hanging backwards.\n\n                         \n\n          The mother lies a couple of feet away, on the floor, half\n\n          over an infant, as if in a final protective gesture.\n\n                         \n\n          Jim looks down at them.\n\n                         \n\n          Then there is a noise behind.\n\n                         \n\n          Instinctively Jim snaps around, swinging the bat as he does\n\n          so - and connects against a small body, which flies\n\n          backwards.\n\n                         \n\n          Only then do we - and Jim - see what he has hit.
