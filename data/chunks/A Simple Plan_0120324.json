Grain is being milled, a loud,\nsteady GRINDING: WE SEE the machinery moving in the shifting\nlight. Shelves line one wall, sagging with burlap sacks. HANK\nMITCHELL is tallying the bags on a Clipboard. He's thirty years\nold, slim, light~haired, dressed in khakis and a sweater.\n\nEXT. FEED MILL - DAY\n\nA tall narrow building, roofed with corrugated tin. It's\nseparated from the feedstore by a barren, snow-covered yard.\nThe snow is dirty, pockmarked with tracks. We still HEAR the\ngrinding, but it's more muffled now.\n\nThe mill's door opens, and Hank emerges, clutching his\nGlipboard. He coughs, spits into the snow, then picks his way\nquickly toward the feedstore, slapping at his sweater and pants\nas he goes, leaving a cloud of dust in the air behind hin.\n\nINT. HANK'S OFFICE = DAY\n\nA tiny office, which Hank shares with his boss, TOM BUTLER. The\nbookshelves are crowded with files; the desks are messy; a\nfluorescent light flickers on the ceiling. Butler, a heavyset\nman approaching forty, is talking on the phone: no words, just\nan intermittent string of HMMM‘'s, UH-HUH's, and UNE-UNH's.\n\nHank enters, plucks the top sheet of paper from his clipboard,\ndeposits it on Butler's desk. Butler scans its columns without\npausing in his conversation. As Hank sits down at his own,\nslightly smaller desk, his watch BEEPS. He fumbles with it,\nchecking the time: it's noon.\n\nHank hurriedly shuts his briefcase, turns off his desk lamp.\nWhen he steps to the door and pulls down his coat, Butler\nglances at his own watch, raising his eyebrows, the phone still\npressed to his ear. Hank hesitates, halfway into his overcoat.\n\nHANK\nThe cemetery..",

SMALL TOWN MAIN ST. - DAY\n\nA small, worn-looking town. The street is lined with two-story\nbuildings, their paint peeling, gutters sagging. The few people\nout and about are dressed heavily against the cold. Snow has\nbeen shoveled into long piles along the sidewalk's edge. Wind-\ntattered Christmas decorations cling to the light poles.\n\nHank emerges from the feedstore, buttoning his overcoat. He\nturns to the right, hurrying, his head ducked against the cold.\n\nMOVING\n\nWe follow Hank down the block. He passes a woman carrying a\nbulging grocery bag, a SMALL CHILD trailing behind her,\nandrogynous in its snow gear. The woman's name is LINDA.\n~ BANK\nHappy New Year, Lindal\n(to the child)\nHappy New Year, Marcil\n\nThe mother and daughter both RESPOND, their faces too muffled by\ntheir scarves for us to make out their words.\n\nHANK walks on, passing a tavern, several stores, the library:\nall of the buildings look equally rundown. Only the town hall\nstands out in any way, a red-brick structure with a police truck\nparked on the street before it. CARL JENKINS, the town\npoliceman, a white-haired, vigorous-looking old man, is scraping\nthe truck's windshield. He waves at Hank.\n\nCARL\nHappy New Year, Hank!\n\nAs Hank waves back, a little girl glides toward him down the\nsidewalk, perched on a sled: silent, almost magical. Hank\nsteps aside to let her pass. Then he turns the corner, starts\ndown the next block. He stops at--\n\nTHE MITCHELL HOUSE\n\n--which is just a bit less dilapidated than its neighbors, an\nessentially rundown building with a thin facade of renovation:\nfresh paint, clean windows, a wreath on the door.",

To his right\nis the dining room, to his left the living room. Nothing's\nexpensive, but all the furnishings have obviously been chosen\nwith care. A poinsettia sits on a table by the front door.\n\nHank drapes his coat over the bannister, bends to remove his\nshoes, then stops, listening. WE HEAR water running, and--too\nfaintly to make out the words--a woman singing. Hank yanks off\nhis shoes, starts quickly up the stairs.\n\nINT. MITCHELL BEDROOM —- DAY\n\nA bed, night tables, a pair of bureaus. Photographs dot the\nwalls; the windows look out onto the street. A door, cracked\nopen, leads to a bathroom. This is where the water's coming\nfrom: Hank's wife, SARAH, is singing in the shower. We can\nHEAR her words now. She's singing, \"In the Bleak Midwinter\".\n\nHank enters, moves to the bathroom door. Very slowly, he pushes\nit open, steps into--\n\nTHE MITCHELL BATHROOM\n\nA sink, toilet and tub. Everything shines whitely, except for\nthe shower curtain, which is bright red. Behind it, Sarah\ncontinues to SING, her voice hauntingly pretty. Hank stands in\nthe center of the room, perfectly silent, listening.\n\nAfter a few beats, the singing stops and the water is turned\noff. Then the shower curtain is slowly pulled open, revealing--\n\nSARAH\n\n--who, like her voice, is hauntingly pretty. She flinches at\nthe sight of Hank, startled, hiding behind the shower curtain.\nIt clings to her body, betraying the huge dome of her belly:\nshe's extremely pregnant. After a moment, she smiles, and Hank\ngrabs a towel, steps forward with it, holding it out to her.\nNeither of them says a word.\n\nINT.

MITCHELL FRONT ENTRANCEWAY - DAY 18\nThe POUNDING resumes, as Hank comes down the stairs. He grabs\nhis coat off the bannister, pulls open the door. His brother,\nJACOB, waits on the porch.

He eyes Hank, taking in his suit and tie.\n\nJACOB\nYou ready?\n\nHank stares past him, buttoning his overcoat.\n19h HANK'S POV — THE STREET 108\nJacob's rusted red pickup idles at the curb.
