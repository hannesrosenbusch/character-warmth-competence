SHACK - DAY\n\n               Darkness. Quiet. The CAMERA MOVES through the gloom of the \n               small, dirty, wooden hut, past a broken table, over a well-\n               worn saddle lying on the floor. Now, a pair of boots standing \n               empty by the rotting remains of a rough-hewn bunk, up to a \n               holstered gun hung on the corner of the bed. The still shape \n               of a man, a bedroll his only protection from the splintery \n               planks. This is EMMETT, fast asleep.\n\n               The door of the shack bursts inward as a Gunman crashes in. \n               For a moment he is silhouetted against the blinding morning \n               light, his two six-guns blasting even before the door has \n               bounced shut behind him, returning the hut to darkness.\n\n               Emmett's holster, the gun gone.\n\n               The gun is here in Emmett's hand, erupting now with three \n               quick explosions. The intruder flies against the far wall of \n               the hut and lands on the floor dead. From outside, two bullets \n               pierce the plank wall behind Emmett, light streaming through \n               in .45 calibre shafts.\n\n               Emmett is out of the bunk and on the floor. He fires once \n               over the bunk. In the moment of quiet that follows, we hear \n               running FOOTSTEPS outside the hut. Emmett follows their \n               progress with the point of his gun, but holds his fire. \n               Suddenly a shotgun blasts a large hole in the roof of the \n               shack, and the table disintegrates in a new column of light.\n\n               Emmett glances upward, but quickly returns his attention to \n               the side walls, trying to follow that gunman. Now more fire \n               comes from there and more footsteps. Another shotgun blast \n               showers Emmett with debris, but he ignores it, concentrating \n               on the walls.\n\n               WHAT HE SEES. The Man Outside moves quickly past a crack in \n               the wall, momentarily revealing his spot by blocking the \n               light. Emmett fires once ahead of him, stopping his progress \n               and forcing him back to the crack.",

The Man Outside moves quickly past a crack in \n               the wall, momentarily revealing his spot by blocking the \n               light. Emmett fires once ahead of him, stopping his progress \n               and forcing him back to the crack. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\n Emmett fires his last \n               shot there, and the man outside goes down hard.\n\n               The shotgun rips another jagged hole in the ceiling and blows \n               a crater in the dirt by Emmett's foot. The shape of a man \n               flashes across the new hole. Emmett looks across the room at \n               the top bunk, where the barrel of his Winchester protrudes a \n               few inches from the bare planks. Emmett throws his empty six-\n               gun noisily into the far corner of the hut. Instantly the \n               man on the roof blasts away in that direction.\n\n               Emmett dives for the bunk. With the tips of his fingers, he \n               pulls hard on the muzzle. The Winchester flips full circle \n               into the air as the bunk behind it is shredded from above.\n\n               With an odd kind of inevitability, as though seeking its \n               rightful place, the Winchester arcs into a shaft of light, \n               where it is met by Emmett's steady, waiting hands. Before it \n               has even settled, he has cocked and fired twice through a \n               hole in the roof. Emmett stops and lowers the carbine. The \n               Man on the Roof falls spread-eagled through the weakened \n               ceiling. Debris and sunlight shower his lifeless form.\n\n               Emmett listens, moves silently to the door, and opens it \n               carefully. WE FOLLOW him outside, out into the bright \n               sunlight, into the awesome promise of the American West.\n\n               EXT. SHACK - DAY\n\n               Emmett moves warily around the isolated shack. There are no \n               more attackers. He looks off into the distance. Two riderless \n               horses, galloping away, are the only moving things in the \n               empty landscape. A third saddled horse, a pinto, stands \n               nervously near Emmett's horse, which is tied to a stake.\n\n               Emmett walks to the body of the Man Outside and looks down \n               at him. He doesn't know him. He moves to the pinto and calms \n               it. He examines the distinctive brand on its flank, a circle \n               with two wavy lines beneath it. Emmett is clearly mystified. \n               He rests his arms on the saddle and stares after the \n               retreating horses.\n\n               THE MAIN TITLE BEGINS.\n\n               EXT.",

EXT. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\n EMMETT RIDES (VARIOUS SHOTS) - DAY/NIGHT\n\n               Emmett travels, the saddled pinto in tow. He moves from high \n               mountain terrain down-country, through meadow and canyon. He \n               makes night camp near a rushing stream. The land flattens as \n               he approaches the desert. The sun beats at him as he dismounts \n               at the edge of a white-hot plain. He takes a short pull from \n               his canteen and squints off across the flat, empty space. \n               All he can see ahead is blinding sand and blue sky.\n\n               THE MAIN TITLE ENDS.\n\n               EXT. DESERT (SERIES OF SHOTS) - DAY\n\n               Emmett is now surrounded by the white blankness, moving slowly \n               under the broiling sun.\n\n               He stops his walking horses and squints out into the distance, \n               seeing something. We see it too, but just barely: a distant, \n               horizontal smudge on the glaring sand.\n\n               Emmett reaches the smudge. It is a man, barefoot and dressed \n               only in longjohns, his head propped on a rock, eyes closed. \n               The man's skin is burned red and beginning to blister, his \n               lips parched. Yet there is a curious ease to his repose. If \n               he has lain down here to die, he has done it in peace. This \n               is PADEN.\n\n               Emmett lifts Paden's head and puts the canteen to his lips. \n               Paden's eyes struggle to open in the glare. He takes a few \n               sips of the water. His lips crack with a slight smile at the \n               taste. He looks up at Emmett, takes another sip, and tries \n               to speak. Emmett must lean down to hear his raspy whisper as \n               he tries again.\n\n                                     PADEN\n                         Pleased to meet you.\n\n               EXT.

Four cowboys come by and \n                         we decide to ride together for a \n                         while, friendly as can be.

We get out in the middle \n                         of that frying pan and suddenly \n                         everybody's pointing their gun but \n                         me. I guess they admired my horse. \n                         She's a great one, a sweet little \n                         bay.\n\n                                     EMMETT\n                         Looks like that's not all they \n                         admired.\n\n                                     PADEN\n                         Yup.

That was right considerate, \n                         I thought. They were laughing when \n                         they left me. Thought it was real \n                         funny. I walked for a little while \n                         but there was no use, so I gave it \n                         up.

Mal looks around the room \n               and walks wearily to the registration desk, although there \n               is no one behind it. He RINGS a bell for service.\n\n               At the sound of the bell several of the patrons look up and \n               spot Mal for the first time. The three Tough Men are instantly \n               displeased at the sight of the black man. Paden, returning \n               to his meal, notes their attitude and glances over at Mal.\n\n               Mal leaves his saddlebags at the registration desk, but takes \n               the rifle as he walks across to the bar. The nervous Waitress \n               is working there.

He puts the bottle \n               down and regards the glass for a long moment of pleasant \n               anticipation. Mal's hand has started for the glass when the \n               saloon's PROPRIETOR appears from a back room.\n\n                                     PROPRIETOR\n                              (sharply)\n                         Hey!

Mal looks across the \n               distance at his only weapon.\n\n                                     PADEN\n                              (quietly, to Emmett)\n                         Doesn't look quite fair.\n\n                                     EMMETT\n                              (watching carefully)\n                         Which way do you mean?\n\n               The Second Man lurches up to the bar and pins Mal's arms \n               behind him. The First Man moves quickly, cocking back his \n               arm for a punch square in Mal's face. As the blow is \n               unleashed, Mal bends forward with terrific speed and force, \n               pulling the Second Man onto his back. The Second Man's face \n               is suddenly where Mal's was an instant ago, and the First \n               Man's punch lands hard on it. Mal slams the Second Man's \n               back against the edge of the bar; he falls to the floor. Mal \n               blocks a blow from the First Man and steps in with a flurry \n               of body blows.\n\n               Back at the Tough Men's table, the Third Man pushes back his \n               chair as if to rise. Emmett has just picked up a chicken \n               leg; now he waves it ever so slightly at the Third Man: \"Stay \n               out of it\". The Man looks at Emmett and Paden, then settles \n               back into his seat.\n\n               Mal sends the First Man crashing down through a table with a \n               final blow. He turns in time to see the Second Man, back on \n               his feet, grab Mal's whiskey bottle and break it against the \n               bar. Mal looks for a frustrated moment at the splashing \n               whiskey -- what a waste. The Second Man lunges with the sharp \n               glass.",

He pushes his \n               chair back slowly and begins to rise as if in compliance. \n               But now a bone-handled Colt is in his hand, clearing his \n               holster. Paden is quicker. He snatches his gun from his belt \n               and fires.\n\n               Paden's eyes, squinting through a cloud of gunsmoke, as we \n               hear the Ugly Cowboy's body CRASH to the floor in his chair. \n               Paden's glance now darts down at an angle.\n\n               WHAT HE SEES. His hat lands on the saloon floor, spins once \n               on its brim, and settles into stillness like a tossed coin.\n\n               Silence in the saloon. Then, in a far corner, the BANGING of \n               chairs and a door SLAMMING. Paden's gun points that way, but \n               there is no one there. Only an overturned chair, and an empty \n               pair of boots -- Paden's.\n\n               Paden picks up his hat and walks toward his boots.",

From the shadows emerge \n               two galloping horses: on the first is Emmett, who holds the \n               reins of the second, across whose saddle is draped the \n               seemingly lifeless body of Paden. The Sentinel watches them \n               pass under the point of his carbine.\n\n               AT THE WAGON. Emmett dismounts quickly and ties both horses \n               to a wheel. Dawson decides not to shoot this guy yet. He \n               watches as Emmett runs back across the canyon to the cover \n               of some crates and crouches down behind them, looking up at \n               the rim above the entrance. The outlaws, guns pointed, stand \n               around him.\n\n                                     TALL OUTLAW\n                              (to Dawson)\n                         Should I kill him, Mr. Dawson?\n\n                                     DAWSON\n                              (approaching Emmett)\n                         In a minute!\n\n               Emmett, still cowering, looks over his shoulder at Dawson. \n               He speaks now, and throughout, very fast.\n\n                                     EMMETT\n                         I wouldn't do that.

After a moment, though, he looks down to see a \n               small woman in a velvet dress -- STELLA.\n\n                                     PADEN\n                         You work here?\n\n                                     STELLA\n                         I run the place. What can I get you?\n\n               She is already moving away toward the near end of the bar. \n               He watches her disappear around the end, then sees the top \n               of her head appear behind the bar down there. As she moves \n               back toward him, she gets taller and taller, until she is \n               facing him eye to eye across the bar.\n\n                                     PADEN\n                         Bourbon.\n\n               As she reaches under the bar and produces bottle and glass, \n               Paden leans over and peeks behind the bar.

MOUNTAIN SPRING - MORNING\n\n               Ezra comes out of the surrounding rocks and goes to the edge \n               of the spring. A stream runs off downhill from the pool. He \n               props the rifle against a rock and bends to drink from the \n               spring. He hears something and turns quickly. What he sees \n               makes him reach for the rifle, but the sound of several GUNS \n               COCKING freezes him inches from it.\n\n               There are four Cowboys, McKendrick's men, emerging from their \n               hiding places.

ROCKY HILLSIDE - MORNING\n\n               Mal, rifle in hand and frantic, is lost among the rocks. Now \n               he stops, listening. He hears HOOFBEATS. He scrambles to the \n               top of a boulder and looks down.\n\n               WHAT HE SEES. The four Cowboys far below are riding away \n               from the base of the hill.\n\n               EXT. MOUNTAIN SPRING - MORNING\n\n               Mal comes out of the rocks. Ezra's rifle is no longer propped \n               where he left it. Ezra is gone. Mal rushes to the edge of \n               the spring, in agony. He looks around desperately, and then \n               freezes.\n\n               Ezra's dead body is floating away down the mountain stream. \n               Mal splashes into the water, tripping and sliding on the \n               slippery rocks.

Didn't kill \n                         him, though. Before you know it, \n                         Paden's off his horse and holding \n                         the dog. He'd gone all strange on \n                         us. Said we should go on without \n                         him. I thought he was kidding at \n                         first. But he wasn't. Tyree was ready \n                         to plug 'em both. And all this with \n                         the posse coming down on us. Here I \n                         thought we were pals after all that \n                         riding. And suddenly he's more worried \n                         about a mutt. So we did like he asked \n                         and left him. He went to jail for a \n                         dog.\n\n               Stella has been listening intently.

Cobb lifts his glass to \n               Paden with a grin, but speaks to Stella.\n\n                                     SHERIFF COBB\n                         And you want to hear the funny part? \n                         Paden didn't even like the damn dog.\n\n               Paden gives Cobb an odd glance but smiles.\n\n                                     PADEN\n                         It evened out in the end.

ARROYO - OUTSIDE SILVERADO - DAY\n\n               We move along the burnished barrel of the old Henry .44 rifle \n               to Emmett's eye, sighting along its length.\n\n               Now we see his target. In the distance is a small cactus \n               plant. Emmett squeezes off a shot. The cactus does not move. \n               He aims again and fires quickly. Again, nothing at the cactus.\n\n               AT THE CACTUS. Now we're right behind the target plant, Emmett \n               in the distance. When he fires, a thin needle at the top \n               edge of the plant is blown away, the bullet leaving a shallow \n               trough in the green skin. He fires again, and the next needle \n               disappears. Now there are four troughs. He's been hitting \n               from the start.\n\n               Emmett lowers the rifle, walks back to his horse tied nearby, \n               and leaves the rifle, then moves away from the horse again.\n\n               He stops, looking at a can in the dust fifty feet away.",

He stops, looking at a can in the dust fifty feet away. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\n He \n               shakes the fingers of his gun hand once, then very quickly: \n               he draws his Colt and fires. The can jumps into the air. \n               While it is still moving, Emmett holsters the gun, releasing \n               it, then draws again and fires. As the can jumps once more, \n               Emmett repeats the action. Six times he draws. The can doesn't \n               stop moving until after the last shot.\n\n               The horrible NOISE echoes away as Emmett holds the empty gun \n               before him.

A lasso \n               settles around his arms and whips him viciously backwards. \n               In a second he is back on his feet and running like a bull \n               toward Deputy Kyle, who has stepped from the brush to throw \n               the rope. Immediately a second lasso catches Emmett from the \n               other side and pulls taut. A deputy on horseback, CHARLIE, \n               has roped him. Charlie and Kyle pull their ropes, yanking \n               Emmett onto his back.\n\n               Now appearing around a bend in the arroyo is Tyree, a nasty \n               glint in his eye. He rides hard directly toward Emmett. Emmett \n               watches the pounding hooves approach. He struggles but can't \n               move. Tyree's horse thunders over him, one hoof catching his \n               side with a sickening THUD. Emmett writhes in agony.\n\n               Tyree turns his horse and heads back. Kyle pulls harder on \n               his rope. Tyree rides over Emmett again, but we can't see \n               the damage for the dust. Tyree walks his horse over and looks \n               down, as Garth, Kyle, and Charlie converge.\n\n               Emmett's head is bleeding, his body crumpled.

Slick throws \n               back a shot and turns to her, upset.\n\n                                     SLICK\n                         Did your brother tell you he killed \n                         a deputy?\n\n               Rae is taken aback.\n\n                                     SLICK\n                         Jake never showed up.

He has been beaten \n               more. As the door to the outer office clangs open, he reacts \n               with resignation; here comes more pain. But when he looks \n               up, it is Paden standing outside the bars. Behind Paden, \n               Garth throws a hostile look at Mal and goes out. Paden notes \n               Mal's condition. Mal regards Paden coolly.\n\n                                     PADEN\n                         Why are they doing this, Mal?\n\n                                     MAL\n                         Because they enjoy it.\n\n                                     PADEN\n                         I heard from Stella you were trying \n                         to find Jake.",

Scruffy stands up from a step and looks off \n               toward the rise beyond the corrals. Alarm creeps into his \n               face.\n\n               AT THE BUNKHOUSE. Swann, his shoulder bandaged, comes out to \n               join a Sentry Cowboy looking with concern at the rise. \n               Suddenly, the Sentry Cowboy starts running toward a saddled \n               horse nearby. Red has jumped from the fence now too and \n               mounted up quickly. The two horsemen head off toward the \n               rise at a gallop.\n\n               Swann looks in alarm at --\n\n               THE CREST OF THE RISE. Pouring into view with a ground-shaking \n               RUMBLE is a huge herd of stampeding cattle.\n\n               AT THE BUNKHOUSE. Swann turns to the door of the bunkhouse \n               and shouts inside.\n\n                                     SWANN\n                         Stampede!\n\n               ON THE RISE.

Scruffy runs across from the casa grande and \n               joins other Cowboys trying to saddle and mount panicked \n               horses. Scruffy's horse rears and breaks away from him.\n\n               ON THE RISE. Red and the Sentry Cowboy are closing with the \n               dust-enshrouded herd, still firing their guns. Suddenly, \n               from the cloud, there are answering shots. The Sentry Cowboy \n               is shot dead off his horse.\n\n               Emerging like a spirit from the dust at the edge of the herd, \n               comes Emmett, six-gun in hand.\n\n               On the other side of the herd, Paden's form materializes. He \n               aims his Winchester and fires. Red's horse rears. Red goes \n               down and the herd pounds over him.\n\n               AT THE BUNKHOUSE. Hoyt comes out the door, buckling on his \n               gunbelt. He looks at the on-rushing stampede, then toward \n               the corral where several Cowboys are swinging up on their \n               horses. Suddenly, there is gunfire from the roof of the \n               bunkhouse above Hoyt. One of the Cowboys in the corral goes \n               down. Another draws his gun and lifts it toward the bunkhouse, \n               but is shot before he can fire. The other Cowboys head for \n               cover. Hoyt stops some men who are coming out the door behind \n               him, and edges out to try to locate the source of the fire.\n\n               ON THE VERANDA. McKendrick comes out of the casa grande and \n               runs to the corner of the veranda nearest the rise. He takes \n               in the stampede, which is almost upon them now, then hears \n               gunfire to his right. He looks back there and sees Mal on \n               the bunkhouse roof, above Hoyt and firing from the protection \n               of the raised rim. Now Mal swings his rifle around toward \n               McKendrick. McKendrick jumps around the corner of the house \n               as the wall where he was standing takes a hit.\n\n               SERIES OF SHOTS. The stampede hits the ranch.

At the top of the stairs behind him, the \n               Watching Cowboy jumps into view. Emmett spins and ducks as \n               the Watching Cowboy fires. The finial splinters.

Suddenly, \n               the Guard Cowboy steps boldly into view in that doorway, gun \n               raised, using Augie as a shield. Emmett cannot fire.

BARN - DAY\n\n               Paden is in an empty stall part-way down one side of the \n               barn. The three Cowboys have him pinned down from the front. \n               Paden's horse does a panicky dance in the central aisle. The \n               horses in the other stalls are spooked.\n\n               Scruffy sneaks in the back door of the barn.

Now the figure drops into view. It's Jake! He dives \n               after Scruffy.\n\n               Paden, reloaded now and unaware of the struggle behind him, \n               has to shrink back from a splintering rail. Now he hears two \n               muffled shots from the back of the barn. He looks over there. \n               After a beat, Jake steps into Paden's view, grinning like a \n               maniac and happily buckling his reacquired gunbelt. Paden \n               does a double take. Jake gives him a big \"Here I am!\" gesture, \n               then indicates he's going up to the loft again to help out \n               with the guys up front. But first, with real relish, he checks \n               his pearl-handled Colts: he draws both at once, tips them up \n               to look into the cylinders, then spins them back into their \n               holsters. Then, with a leap, to the loft.\n\n               EXT. RANGE NEAR CASA GRANDE - DAY\n\n               McKendrick rides flat out toward town.\n\n               INT.

Paden looks along the bunkhouse, where he can see \n               Mal firing. Mal is protected at present from Hoyt by the big \n               chimney he is braced against. But if he isn't warned, Hoyt \n               will surprise him. A Cowboy in the bunkhouse spots Paden and \n               fires at him. Paden must warn Mal quickly. Yelling is hopeless \n               in the din. Paden aims carefully at Mal and fires.\n\n               AT MAL. The chimney is hit just above Mal's head. He swings \n               his rifle around toward -- Paden! Paden signals wildly about \n               Hoyt. Mal understands just in time: he flops around the \n               chimney just as Hoyt gets a bead on him. Without knowing it, \n               Mal avenges his father's murder.

As McKendrick's fire hits around him, Emmett turns \n               into the nearest cover -- the loading yard of the feed \n               warehouse. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\n               McKendrick rides toward the mouth of the loading yard with \n               all he's got. He can't let Emmett reload. The glint of victory \n               is in his eyes as he draws near the loading yard.\n\n               He raises his rifle in preparation for the coming clear shot \n               at his trapped enemy. As his horse begins to pass in front \n               of the loading yard, we hear a terrible RUMBLE OF HOOFBEATS \n               on wood. McKendrick's expression changes to horror.\n\n               Emmett has ridden onto the loading dock of the warehouse and \n               charged toward this end. Now he jumps his horse straight out \n               into the air over McKendrick's horse. The hooves of Emmett's \n               horse catch McKendrick full force with a HORRIBLE SOUND.\n\n               Emmett's horse lands on its feet, but just barely. From a \n               cloud of dust Emmett watches McKendrick's horse race on, \n               riderless. Its master is a still shape in the dirt.\n\n               EXT. STREET - DAY\n\n               Stella has been hurrying through the empty streets. Now she \n               pauses to listen to the new silence.\n\n               EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n               Cobb listens too. He sits on the steps at the front of his \n               office, toying with an object in his hands. Now he brings it \n               to his mouth. It is his sheriff's badge, and he breathes a \n               fog onto it, then polishes it on his sleeve. He looks at it \n               another moment, smiles to himself, then pins it on his chest.\n\n               EXT. STREETS NEAR SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n               Paden is walking. He is calm. He rounds a corner and moves \n               out into the center of the new street.\n\n               AT THE END OF THE STREET. Cobb looks up from his seat and \n               sees Paden coming toward him. He had a feeling it would be \n               this way. It makes him sad. He stands up and walks to the \n               center of the street.\n\n               Paden keeps coming. He watches Cobb, resigned. Now Paden \n               stops.\n\n               Stella comes out of an alley. When she takes in the scene, \n               she steps onto the sidewalk and puts her hand on a post.",

Now the \n               glasses are lifted by Mal, Jake, Paden, and Emmett. Stella \n               holds up the bottle and proposes a toast --\n\n                                     STELLA\n                         To California!\n\n               They echo her and clink glasses. Stella clinks with the \n               bottle. When they toss back their drinks, she tips the bottle \n               to her lips, then puts it down on the bar, as the four glasses \n               come down.\n\n                                     EMMETT\n                         Gotta go.\n\n                                     MAL\n                         Right.\n\n               The four men move toward the door as Stella walks down her \n               ramp. Emmett walks with a slight limp.\n\n               EXT. MIDNIGHT STAR - MORNING\n\n               Phoebe stands on the porch talking across to Rae, much \n               recovered, who sits on the seat of a wagon heavily loaded \n               with farming supplies. Rae wears a simple dress and looks \n               quite different.\n\n               The men come out onto the porch. Emmett shakes Mal's hand \n               and watches him climb onto the wagon.

In \n               the back seat, a blanket across his legs, sits J.T. They \n               wait for the brothers.
