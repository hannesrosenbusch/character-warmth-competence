Erect, he'd be nearly seven feet tall, and is twice\nthe mass of an average man, covered in hair - much of it\ngreying. Immense arms lead to massive hands, the tough nails\ntools for a brutal existence.\n\nHis face - or what can be made of it in the falling light -\nhas a leatherish quality. It also betrays age, as does a\nnoticeable limp: this is a gigantic nocturnal primate - a\ntroll who has seen better days.\n\nHe scans the meadow, puzzled. He CLUCKS his tongue a couple\nof times...
