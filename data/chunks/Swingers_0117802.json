Below is neon and the icy\n\n        thrust of search lights rotating on the corner of Hollywood\n\n        and Vine.\n\n\n\n        We continue west, then quickly north.\n\n\n\n        There is the momentary appearance of the moonlit HOLLYWOOD\n\n        sign as we pass the blinking red beacon of the Capital\n\n        Records building and drop into Franklin avenue and over the\n\n        101.\n\n\n\n        Architectural remnants of Hollywood's past whip up.  We are\n\n        heading east at treetop level.  A warm glow in the distance\n\n        quickly grows into a modest commercial strip which includes\n\n        cafes, bookstores, and a theater.\n\n\n\n        We drop to eye level as we spy through the plate glass\n\n        showcase window of the \"Bourgeois Pig\" coffeehouse, which\n\n        holds the translucent reflection of the full moon.\n\n\n\n        A cigarette wedged between knuckles smoulders.  MIKE takes\n\n        the last drag with great effort, then crushes it out.  He\n\n        sits in the window sprawled across a red velvet couch that\n\n        once perfectly complemented a faux spanish foyer.\n\n\n\n                                                         MATCH CUT TO:\n\n\n\n   2    EXT.  \"BOURGEOIS PIG\" COFFEEHOUSE - COUCHES AND TABLE IN FRONT   2\n\n        WINDOW - NIGHT\n\n\n\n        ROB sits down next to Mike, pouring himself some tea.\n\n\n\n                             MIKE\n\n                   And what if I don't want to give up on\n\n                   her?\n\n\n\n                             ROB\n\n                   You don't call.\n\n\n\n                             MIKE\n\n                   But you said I shouldn't call if I\n\n                   wanted to give up on her.\n\n\n\n                             ROB\n\n                   Right.",
