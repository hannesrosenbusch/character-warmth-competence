A\n\n          strong wind bends them back, showing their light green\n\n          bellies.\n\n\n\n          This is a modest house in a row of modest houses. Propane\n\n          tanks and farmland at their backs show this neighborhood to\n\n          be more rural than suburb.\n\n\n\n          CURTIS LAFORCHE(35) stands in his driveway. His eyes, locked\n\n          on the sky, narrow as he stares at...\n\n\n\n          A STORM CELL stretching out on the horizon in front of him.\n\n          It's a bruised sky filled with a vicious mixture of black and\n\n          gray clouds. They swirl in and out of one another sending\n\n          wispy tentacles toward the ground.\n\n\n\n          Curtis stands, awestruck.\n\n\n\n          The clouds move fast overhead. He looks up as they overtake\n\n          his position. A light rain begins.\n\n\n\n          The rain pats the ground. It makes soft indentions on his\n\n          cotton shirt. He watches it hit the concrete, falling harder\n\n          now. He notices something strange.\n\n\n\n          The rain makes dark spots on the sidewalk. He pulls his\n\n          shirt out and sees dark spots forming there. He holds his\n\n          palm out flat in front of him. The rain pools.\n\n\n\n          He rubs the water through his thumb and fingers. It's an\n\n          amber color, viscous, like fresh motor oil.\n\n\n\n          Curtis looks to the sky, the rain pelting his face now.\n\n          Jagged, angry clouds blanketing overhead. The wind bends\n\n          back the trunk of the maple tree.\n\n\n\n          Curtis stands alone at the base of the surging STORM CELL.\n\n\n\n          TITLE: TAKE SHELTER\n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n          INT.

Concern\n\n          on her face, she nods to him.\n\n          Curtis sees her nod.\n\n          Samantha's eyes, still locked on Curtis, soften, as if to\n\n          apologize. After a moment, she mouths to him, \"I love you.\"\n\n          Curtis nods back to her.\n\n          She looks back up to the shoreline.\n\n\n\n          ON THE BEACH,\n\n          Curtis' feet kick up sand as he rushes back toward the condo.\n\n\n\n          AT THE CONDO,\n\n          Samantha hasn't moved from the porch. A light rain begins to\n\n          fall. Her hands grip the railing. She turns her left palm\n\n          up. Dark rain collects there.\n\n\n\n          ON THE HORIZON IN FRONT OF HER,\n\n\n\n          THE WATER HAS RECEDED INTO THE GULF SOME 100 YARDS. THE DARK\n\n\n\n          SANDY BOTTOM LOOKS ODD STRETCHED OUT SO FAR. A STORM CELL\n\n\n\n          SITS MASSED ON THE HORIZON. CHURNING BLACK CLOUDS FILLED\n\n\n\n          WITH LAYERS OF HORIZONTAL LIGHTNING.\n\n          Behind Samantha, Curtis appears in the open sliding door\n\n          clutching Hannah. The Storm Cell is reflected in the glass\n\n          next to him.\n\n\n\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\n\n           Sam.\n\n          Samantha looks down at her palm. She rubs the thick, viscous\n\n          rain in her fingers. She looks back up at the storm.\n\n          On Samantha's face,\n\n\n\n                          SAMANTHA\n\n           Okay.\n\n\n\n           THE END.\n\n\n\n                          \n\n\n\n"
