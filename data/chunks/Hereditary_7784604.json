It’s\nempty, but evidence of frantic creative activity abounds.\n\nWe PAN across the wall, crossing a series of meticulously\nhand-crafted DOLLHOUSES, mostly works in progress. As we\ndrift past these unfinished dioramas, our trajectory becomes\nclearer...\n\nWe are moving in on an extraordinary sculpture of a\nbeautiful, rustic CRAFTSMAN HOME, at 1:8 scale. Its front\nwall has been removed, exposing its rooms in graphic\ntableaux. This huge miniature is painstakingly detailed. It’s\nadorned with shrunken props/decorations (flashlights, pill\nbottles, shoes, etc.) and teensy furniture, all flawlessly\nrendered and distinguishable ONLY IN SIZE from their full-\nscale models.\n\nWe continue to pan/track across the miniature, edging CLOSER\nAND CLOSER as we drift along its tiny rooms. We finally\narrive at a miniature replica of a TEENAGE BOY’S BEDROOM on\nthe second floor.\n\nWe push towards this until the ROOM FILLS THE FRAME. The\nbright morning sun beams in through its window. It becomes\napparent that a handsome, skinny BOY is sleeping in the bed.\nThis is PETER GRAHAM (17).\n\nWe continue pushing gently in, remaining in a wide of the\nroom (whose status as a miniature has now been confused). The\ndoor opens and STEVE GRAHAM (47) - tall, broad-shouldered,\nformal - pops his head in. He wears a black suit.\n\nSTEVE\nAll right, Petey. Wake up time.\n\nPeter stirs awake. Steve drops a folded-up BLACK SUIT AND TIE\non the foot of the bed.\n\nSTEVE (CONT'D)\nHere’s your suit.\n\nMAX, the family’s golden retriever, shuffles happily in\nthrough the door.\n\nSTEVE (CONT'D)\nDid your sister sleep in her room\nlast night?\n\nEXT.

We are subtly BOOMING DOWN from this wide view\n(as Steve begins to climb the tree) to arrive at a parked CAR\n- one of two family cars - in the foreground.\n\nSitting in the passenger seat is a bereaved woman (45). She\nwears all black, and is beautiful in a worn way. This is\nANNIE GRAHAM, and she looks emotionally exhausted.\n\nShe wears a delicate NECKLACE bearing an ORNATE SIGIL, which\nshe compulsively fingers.\n\nEXT. TREEHOUSE - SAME TIME 3\nSteve pokes his head into the treehouse, where he finds:\nCHARLIE - a plump, androgynous fourteen year old girl - lying\nasleep on the floor. She wears a parka and pajama bottoms.\nBeside her is a DRAWING PAD and an open SHOEBOX.\n\nSTEVE\nOh my God, Charlie. Are you crazy?\n\nCharlie wakes up, her nose pink and runny.

FUNERAL HOME - CHAPEL - MORNING 4\n\nA moderately attended FUNERAL. (A large group of MEN AND\nWOMEN observe from the back.)\n\nBefore the altar, an OPEN CASKET rests beside a blown up\nphoto of the deceased ELLEN LEIGH, Annie’s 75 year old\nmother.\n\nAnnie, Steve, Charlie (now wearing an oversized black dress\nover her pajama bottoms) and Peter sit in the first row of\nchairs. They listen as a LARGE WOMAN (60s) speaks in\nremembrance of Ellen.\n\nLARGE WOMAN\nEllen was a tough one.

Organ music plays as Annie, Steve, Peter (who\ndoesn’t look) and Charlie shuffle by.\n\nCharlie peers into the open casket to see her grandmother's\nCORPSE. It wears a NECKLACE with a delicate SIGIL ORNAMENT\n(identical to Annie’s). The seams in the corpse’s make-up are\neerily apparent and the lips are slightly twisted.\n\nUnnerved, Charlie looks away. She meets eyes with a smiling\nMIDDLE-AGED BLONDE MAN standing in the queue behind her. He’s\nSTARING at her - an overly sentimental look in his eyes.\nDisturbed, Charlie averts her eyes. “Yeesh.\"”\n\nSECONDS LATER\n\nAn older WOMAN arrives at the open casket. Her finger is\ndipped into a small bottle of OIL. She quickly and covertly\nSTREAKS the oil along the corpse’s lips.\n\nSeeing this, a following mourner squints with bewilderment.\n\fGreen Rev.

GRAHAM HOUSE - FOYER - EVENING 6\nThe house is unlit and seemingly vacant.\n\nOff-screen, we hear FEET SCURRYING and a DOOR CLOSING. Max,\nthe golden retriever, BARKS in reaction to this.\n\nA moment later, the front door opens and the Graham family\nenters. They stamp the snow off their boots and remove their\ncoats.\n\nMax runs up, desperate to greet them. Steve bends down to\nhappily receive him.\n\nCharlie moves toward the stairs, still wearing her boots.\n\nSTEVE\nHey hey -- shoes off.\n\nCharlie pulls off her boots.

He dashes for the ATTIC STAIRS.\n\nHe runs up the stairs and immediately RETRACTS them - just as\nAnnie reaches him. Peter manages to pull the attic hatch\nSHUT, almost catching Annie’s bloody fingers.\n\nINT. ATTIC - CONTINUOUS 151\n\nPeter LOCKS the floor’s hatch. There is a mad POUNDING from\nbeneath.\n\nINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 152\n\nAnnie is UPSIDE DOWN and straddling the ceiling (as though\ngravity were no longer a thing). She pulls at the attic knob,\nSLAMMING her head into the hatch.\n\nShe bangs her head crazily against the ceiling, over and\nover. With every strike, she POUNDS her forehead harder and\nmore wildly against the hatch - like a mad bull, trying to\nbreak through by sheer force.\n\nINT. ATTIC - CONTINUOUS 153\n\nPeter stands in the dark, screaming and crying as the\npounding persists. It keeps growing harder, faster, more\ninsane - until it STOPS.\n\nPeter listens... Nothing.

A\nprolonged GROAN, accompanied by the sound of WIRE being\nwrapped and tightened around FLESH. It’s coming from a source\nabout twenty feet away, BEHIND him. This is followed by a\nswifter, HARSHER SOUND - like a saw being dragged through\nflesh. A pregnant PAUSE and then the sound REPEATS. A briefer\npause and it REPEATS again.\n\nPeter slowly turns around. His eyes travel up to SEE...\n\nANNIE has somehow gotten in. She floats weightlessly in the\nair. (She is faintly illuminated by a candle below her.) She\nhas looped the PIANO WIRE around her own NECK, which is\nalready straining blood. She TUGS on one end of the wire. It\nSAWS through her neck.
