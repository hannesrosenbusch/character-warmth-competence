MOON\n\n\n\n     Camera begins to pull back slowly, straight up - the\n\n     song \"Moon Shadow\" by Cat Stevens begins.  Once we are\n\n     high enough to see the entire moon, the main title is\n\n     superimposed.\n\n\n\n               An American Werewolf in London\n\n\n\n     We continue to retreat from the moon, looking on as it\n\n     grows farther from us, continuing credits until the\n\n     full moon is the size it appears to us from earth.\n\n\n\n2    EXT. CROSSROADS ON THE MOORS - NIGHT\n\n\n\n     Tree branches enter into the frame, the camera pans\n\n     down and we see a truck approaching.  We are at a\n\n     crossroads in the moors, looking sinister enough to\n\n     have earned their literary reputation.\n\n\n\n     The truck stops at the crossroads, the DRIVER,\n\n     mustached and wearing tweeds, boots, and a muffler,\n\n     climbs down.\n\n\n\n     \"Moon Shadow\" ends.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\n\n\n     Loud bang of the back grating on the truck as it slams\n\n     down.  Revealed among the sheep are two rudely-awakened\n\n     young American boys.  They look exhausted.  They both\n\n     carry backpacks, two American kids on a jaunt in\n\n     Europe.  They are both in their late twenties.\n\n\n\n     It is very cold and they clamber out of the truck none\n\n     too happily.  Pushing sheep aside they step out and\n\n     stretch.\n\n\n\n     JACK GOODMAN AND DAVID KESSLER\n\n\n\n     They've been cramped for hours.\n\n\n\n                         TRUCK DRIVER\n\n               Here, lads, East Proctor and\n\n               all about are the moors.

He\n\n     stops suddenly, ears perked, he looks about and then we\n\n     hear Jack's o.s. screams.  The voice of Jack screams:\n\n\n\n                         JACK (O.S.)\n\n               David!  David!  Please help\n\n               me!  Oh God!  David!  Oh my\n\n               God!\n\n\n\n     David turns in blind panic, he runs (and we run with\n\n     him) desperately trying to find the source of Jack's\n\n     screams.\n\n\n\n     He comes to a clearing in the woods, light streaming\n\n     through the tall trees.  Jack's screams halt in mid-\n\n     word.  David looks in disbelief at the clearing.  There\n\n     is a hospital bed with someone in it.  It is the same\n\n     as David's.\n\n\n\n     David walks toward it slowly.  The figure in the bed\n\n     lays still.  It grows dark, very dark, and David looks\n\n     up at the full moon.  There is a howl identical to the\n\n     one heard earlier back on the moors.  David approaches\n\n     the bed slowly, fearfully.  We hear ocean noises on the\n\n     soundtrack, the sound of crashing surf.  David reaches\n\n     out to pull back the covers, lightning and thunder\n\n     cause him to hesitate for a second.  Silence.  The\n\n     camera remains on David as he pulls off the covers.\n\n     His face registers total disbelief and increasing\n\n     horror.",

But it's\n\n               something to do. 92   INT. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\n POLICE STATION - NIGHT\n\n\n\n     An officer unlocks a rack of rifles which are\n\n     distributed to uniformed men.\n\n\n\n93   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT\n\n\n\n     Police cars arrive, sirens blaring.  Officers are\n\n     pushing the crowd back as other men help hold the door\n\n     closed against the Wolf's battering.\n\n\n\n     Another police car pulls up and out steps Lt. Villiers\n\n     and Sgt. McManus.\n\n\n\n                         LT. VILLIERS\n\n               What the hell is going on\n\n               here?\n\n\n\n                         COP\n\n               It's some kind of animal, sir.\n\n               We....\n\n     Suddenly the doors splinter apart and there stands the\n\n     Wolf, eyes blazing.  It leaps on Lt. Villiers, savaging\n\n     him.  The crowd falls back in panic.\n\n\n\n     The Wolf runs into traffic, a cab swerves to avoid\n\n     hitting it and plows into fleeing pedestrians hurling\n\n     one through a shop window.  Mass confusion as orders\n\n     are shouted and the police pursue the Wolf.\n\n\n\n     It runs down an alleyway into a cul de sac.  It stops\n\n     in the darkness, blocked by a brick wall.  The Wolf\n\n     whirls around, defiant, roaring.  The cops quickly\n\n     barricade the entrance to the alley.\n\n\n\n94   INT. TAXI - NIGHT\n\n\n\n     The taxi is halted by the traffic jam in Leicester\n\n     Square.  Police vehicles roar past.\n\n\n\n                         ALEX\n\n               David!

The\n\n     officers shout after her.  Dr. Hirsch reaches the\n\n     police line.\n\n\n\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n\n               Alex!\n\n\n\n     Alex walks towards the dark end of the alley.\n\n\n\n                         ALEX\n\n               David?  Is it you?  Is it\n\n               true, David?\n\n\n\n     She's almost to the end.  The Wolf lays in wait in the\n\n     shadows.  The police raise their weapons.",
