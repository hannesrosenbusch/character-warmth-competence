As she searches\n\n          for change in her pockets, Alec stops her and puts his\n\n          own coins in the machine. He presses buttons as he\n\n          talks.\n\n\n\n                         ALEC\n\n          Did you know that I.always wanted\n\n          to make you coffee? I tried once\n\n          -- when you were in the shower --\n\n          but it didn't turn out right, so I\n\n          threw it out and cleaned everything\n\n          up so you wouldn't know.
