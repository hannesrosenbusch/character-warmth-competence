MOUNTAINS - NIGHT\n\nA full moon rises over a white blanketed expanse of meadow\nfreshly dusted with powder.  In the distance, a dark wall of\npine rises into the crisp, blue-black night.  The landscape\nis serene, tranquil, needing only airborne reindeer to\nelevate it to Christmas card status.  Suddenly a young girl,\neight or nine years old, races into frame, LONG LENS STACK,\nrunning for all she's worth.  Her hair is close-cropped, a\nmilitary buzz.  She wears only a nightgown, no shoes.  Her\nbare feet blast through the snow as YOUNG MAX powers across\nthe open meadow.\n\nA SUNGUN xenon spotlight moves across the ground like a death\nray, searching left and right among the trees.\n\nANGLE ON A SNOW COVERED MEADOW as the xenon beam sweeps the\ntrees nearby.  It passes on and the sound of the chopper\nfades.  Out of the treeline bursts the running figure.\n\nLONG LENS, WHIP PANNING with Max as she runs.  HEAR the sound\nof her breathing, deep and regular, like a horse.  She runs\nlike a machine, no stumbling, no wasted motion.  Her breath\ntrails behind her in the frigid mountain air.  Closer now, we\nsee her nightgown is actually a hospital gown.\n\n                     MAX (V.O.)\n          The escape was not my idea.  I mean,\n          escape to what?  We didn't know there was\n          anything else.\n\nMax reaches the treeline just as the xenon spot sweeps over\nagain.  It slashes bright light through the branches, then\nmoves away.  She looks up, taking deep, controlled breaths,\nthen runs.\n\nEXT.

Behind\nlogs and tree trunks, several other children are concealed.\nShe joins them wordlessly, exchanging hand signals with the\noldest boy, ZACK.  There are eight of them, all about Max's\nage, except for two older boys.  They have the same severe\nhaircuts.  Like Max, they are not dressed for the cold but\nthey don't seem affected by it.  We may notice that they all\nhave a curious looking mark on the back of their necks...a\nbar-code.\n\nAnother child makes it to the rally point...a girl, JONDY.\nShe joins Max and they clasp hands.  The children look across\nthe meadow, hoping to see more coming, but Jondy is the last.\nThey hear distant POPS of gunfire.\n\nThe sound of the snowmobiles grows steadily louder.  Zack\npoints at his wrist, an imaginary watch, and makes a slashing\nsigh with his hand.  Out of time.  With vigorous hand signals\nhe separates the children into escape-and-evade teams, two to\na team.  Max and Jondy are paired.  The children's manner is\nclipped, military and much older than their years.\n\n                     MAX (V.O.)\n          It was Zack who said we had to leave.  So\n          I guessed he saved my life... And I never\n          even got the chance to thank him.\n\nThe kids nod perfunctorily to Zack and head off, running\nthrough the trees in their teams of two.  Max indicates she\ndoesn't want to leave Zack alone but he reiterates the order\nwith sharp hand signals.  Finally, Jondy pulls Max by the\narm, leaving Zack, who scans the forest with bright, feral\neyes.\n\nEXT.
