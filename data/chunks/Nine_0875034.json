You kill it writing it down,\n\n            you kill it with a camera; the film\n\n            might come to life for a moment or two\n\n            when your actors breathe life back\n\n            into it - but then it dies again,\n\n            buried in film cans. Mysteriously,\n\n            sometimes, in the editing room, a\n\n            miracle happens when you place one\n\n            image next to another so that when,\n\n            finally, an audience sits in the dark,\n\n            if you're lucky -- very lucky - and\n\n            sometimes I've been lucky - the dream\n\n            flickers back to life again.

An\n\nescape from his tortured reality.\n\n\n\nThe figure emerges gradually, like a goddess. She is\n\ngorgeous, imposing, and seductive. She is CLAUDIA, his\n\nfilm star, his muse. When Claudia reaches Guido, she\n\nstops in front of him, takes his hands from his face,\n\nand kisses him. And with that gesture, the music\n\nswells, the lighting grid rises majestically into the\n\nair, the gritty soundstage transforms into something\n\nbeautiful, transforms into the interior world of\n\nGUIDO'S FANTASY.\n\n\n\nAs Claudia moves away, more and more women slowly\n\nappear.

Harsh daylight\n\npenetrates the gloom. Too bright. He blinks,\n\ndiscombobulated, as a group of silhouetted figures\n\napproach with purpose. One of the figures is a well-\n\nfed, amiable character, DANTE. He is Guido's longtime\n\nassociate and Producer. A younger, more ascetic figure\n\naccompanies him, sharp and birdlike.
