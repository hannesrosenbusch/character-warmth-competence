A few walk up and down the aisles.\nCELINE, a young woman in her mid-twenties, is curled up in\nher seat reading Georges Bataill’s Story of the Eye.\nStrikingly attractive, she plays it down by wearing no\nmakeup, a loose-fitting vintage dress, and flat shoes. She\ncontinues reading while taking an occasional bite of a\nchocolate bar. Sitting four rows back and on the other side\nof the aisle, JESSE, also mid-twenties, is engrossed in Klaus\nKinski’s memoir, All I Need Is Love. Casually good looking\nbut a little scruffy, he dresses in the jeans and T-shirt\nmode. Suddenly a couple, two fortyish types who have been\narguing semiquietly in the seat behind Celine, start yelling\nat each other in German. The WIFE takes a swipe at the\nnewspaper the HUSBAND has been screening him behind.\n\nWIFE\nWill you put down that damn\nnewspaper and listen to me?\n\nHUSBAND\nWhat’ve I been doing the last\nthirty minutes? Would you shut up\nfor Chrissake?\n\nWIFE\nYou shut up! How dare you tell me\nto shut up! It’s the same damn\nthing all over again! I can’t\nbelieve --\n\nHUSBAND\nI said shut up! I’m putting down\nmy newspaper and telling you to\nshut up.\n\nCeline suddenly gets up, grabs her bag, and starts looking\nfor another seat. A few rows back, she finds a seat across\nthe aisle from Jesse. Before sitting down, they make brief\neye contact and kind of shake their heads and smile at the\ntension. Just as she settles in and goes back to her book,\nthe wife gets up and storms down the aisle. Jesse and Celine\nfollow her with their eyes, and as she passes them, they find\nthey are looking right at each other. He makes a funny “uh-\noh” face.",

My\nGerman is not that good.\n(a beat)\nHave you ever heard that as couples\nget older they lose their ability\nto hear each other?\n\nJESSE\nReally?\n\nCELINE\nSupposedly men lose their ability\nto hear higher-pitched sounds and\nwomen eventually lose hearing on\nthe low end. I guess they sort of\nnullify each other or something.\n\nJESSE\nMust be nature’s way of allowing\ncouples to grow old together and\nnot kill each other, I guess.\n\nThere’s a slightly awkward moment where they don’t know if\nthey should continue talking or not. She glances back down\nat her book but he keeps looking at her.\n\nJESSE (CONT'D)\nWhat are you reading?\n\nShe holds up the book so he can see what it is.\n\nCELINE\nHow about you?\n\nHe shows her what he’s reading. Neither has much to say\nabout the other’s reading material.\n\nCELINE (CONT'D)\n\nThere are so many weird people on\nthe train, no? Last week on my way\nto Budapest I was sitting and\ntalking with four other people in\nthe lounge car and it turned out\nthat three of them had killed\npeople.\n\nJESSE\nNo way.\n\fCELINE\nReally. One was a war veteran, one\nhad murdered her boyfriend, and\nanother had caused a bad car wreck.\n\nJESSE\nSo you were the only one who hadn’‘t\nkilled anyone?\n\nCELINE\nNo, I was one of them. Which one\ndo you think?\n\nShe laughs and he slowly joins her.\n\nJESSE\nI know what you mean. I’ve met\nsome weirdos. There was this\nBritish guy sitting across from me\nthe other day who kept throwing his\nbody against the back of his chair,\nyelling about how we should all\njoin together and stop the train.\nHe was saying, “Everybody, now, we\ncan stop technology. All\ntogether...”\n\nCELINE\nSo what happened?\n\nHe demonstrates by throwing his body against his seat.\n\nJESSE\nAnd you know, me and a few others\ntried for a while, but we couldn’t\nstop technology.",

You\nwanna go?\n\nCELINE\nWe better.\n\nThey get up and walk to the door of their car. He pushes the\nDOOR OPEN button, and as the door opens, he extends his hand\ntoward her.\n\fJESSE\nOh, I’m Jesse. It’s James,\nactually, but my whole life\neveryone’s called me Jesse.\n\nCELINE\nSo it’s Jesse James?\n\nJESSE\nNo, just Jesse.\n\nCELINE\nCeline.\n\nThey proceed through the door and Celine pushes the DOOR OPEN\nbutton to enter the next car. There is some confusion as to\nwho is opening the door for whom before Celine proceeds and\njesse follows her toward the lounge car.\n\nINT. LOUNGE CAR - AFTERNOON 2\n\nThey sit at a table, eating chips and taking an occasional\nswig from a drink.\n\nJESSE\nSo how do you speak such good\nEnglish?\n\nCELINE\n\nI went to school for a summer in\nLos Angeles and I’ve spent some\ntime in London. How do you speak\nsuch good English?\n\nJESSE\nI’m American.\n\nCELINE\nI know. It’s a joke. I knew you\nwere American, and, of course, you\ndon’t speak any other language.\n\nJESSE\nYeah, yeah, I’m the dumb, vulgar\nAmerican who has no culture. But I\ntried. I want you to know I took\nfour years of French. I tried, I\nwas ready. When I was in Paris, I\nwas standing in line at the metro\ngoing, “Un billet, s’il vous plait.\n\n(MORE )\n\fJESSE (CONT'D)\nUn billet, s’il vous plait.” And\nthen I got up to the window, I\nlooked up at the lady and blanked\nout. “Uh, uh, I need a ticket for\nthe subway.” No more French for\nme.\n\n(a beat)\n\nSo where are you headed?\n\nCELINE\nBack to Paris.

I’m flying out of\nthere tomorrow morning.\n\nCELINE\nAre you on a holiday?\n\nJESSE\nI don’t know what I’m on. I’ve\njust been traveling around the last\ntwo or three weeks.\n\nCELINE\nWere you visiting friends, or just\ngoing around on your own?\n\fJESSE\n\nI visited a friend in Madrid for a\nwhile, but mostly I’ve just been...\n\n(new thought)\nI got one of those Eurail passes,\nand you know what’s fascinating\nabout traveling around? You spend\nall this time trying to reach your\ndestination, you get there, you\nlook around, it’s never exactly\nwhat you’d hoped, you head off\nsomewhere else, and hope for\nsomething better.\n\nCELINE\nIt’s like getting ready for a\nparty, getting there, and falling\nasleep. That’s why when I’m\ntraveling I kind of force myself\nnot to expect anything from\nanywhere or anyone. And then,\nwhatever happens is a surprise.\nThe most insignificant thing can\nbecome an endless subject of\ninterest, no?\n\nJESSE\nThat’s what I like about traveling -\nyou can sit down, maybe talk to\nsomeone interesting, see something\nbeautiful, read a good book, and\nthat’s enough to qualify a good\nday. You do that at home and\neveryone thinks you’re a bum.\n\nCELINE\nI like that though. But it’s like\nmy favorite American writers. They\ndescribe everything you wouldn’t\nwant to live through, and yet you\ncannot stop reading of this\nexciting, boring life.\n\nJESSE\nSo what do you study?\n\nCELINE\nLiterature. But I haven’t decided\nyet what I really want to do.\n\nJESSE\nDo you want to write?\n\fCELINE\n\nYeah, but...\n\n(new thought)\nI kind of had this obsession a few\nyears ago about creating a new form\nof expression.",

I was especially rejecting\nwords. They seemed so rusted and\ndirty. And they’ve been used for\nsuch evil ends. Sometimes, you\nknow, language is so limited. It’s\nlike...if you think about it...\n\nShe holds her hands out fairly wide and round.\n\nCELINE (CONT'D)\nThis is an individual’s mental\nexperience and perception and...\n\nShe holds her hands together and forms a small circle.\n\nCELINE (CONT'D)\nThis is how much can be expressed\nthrough language. We just don’t\nhave words for so many of the\nimpressions we have.\n\nShe parts her hands and gestures to the large outer circle.\n\nCELINE (CONT'D)\nSo most of our life we will never\nbe able to express to anyone.\n\nThey sit there for an extended moment, neither sure what to\nsay next. Suddenly Jesse smiles and jokingly starts to get\nup.\n\nJESSE\nSo I guess...that’s it - it’s been\nnice not communicating with you.\n\nThey both laugh.\n\nJESSE (CONT'D)\nReally, though, I basically agree\nwith you, and maybe it’s a sad face\nof life, but I think it doesn’t\nbother me that much. Maybe I’m\nwrong about this, but I think that\nlack of communication frustrates\nwomen more than men.\n\fCELINE\nYes, because men are perfectly\ncontent to sit in front of TV all\nday drinking beer and watching\nsports.\n\nJESSE\nYeah, that’s true, but have you\never done that? I did it once with\na friend of mine. Drank some beer,\nhad some chips, and watched a\ncouple of games. It was the first\ntime in years I literally jumped\nfor joy. On some level it’s\nsticking your head in the sand, but\non another I think it must serve\nsome tribal purpose.\n\nCELINE\nI actually agree with you. I kind\nof like sports.

Can I\ntell you about it?\n\nCELINE\nYes.\n\nJESSE\nSome friends of mine are these\ncable access producers - you know,\nanyone can produce a program, and\nthey have to show it. I got really\njazzed about it. I imagined a show\nI want to produce that would last\nan entire year, twenty-four hours a\nday. I want to get 365 different\nvideo producers around the world to\neach make their own twenty-four-\nhour-long document of real time,\ncapturing life around them just as\nit is lived. So it’d be people\nwaking up, taking a long shower,\ngetting a cup of coffee and reading\nthe paper for twenty minutes, a\nlong drive to work.\n\nCELINE\nYou mean all those boring, mundane\nthings everyone has to do every day\nof their life?\n\nJESSE\nI was going to say the poetry of\nday-to-day life.\n\n(MORE )\n\f10.\n\nJESSE (CONT'D)\nI mean, Why is your dog so great\njust for sleeping in the sun?

I\nwould cut down the light, sit at\nthe window, and watch them sitting\non a couch doing nothing. It was\nfascinating.\n\nJESSE\nThat’s the trick. Life is not\nreally about drama. That we all do\nthe same shit and going to some\nmarket in Arabia is the same as\ngoing to Kmart in Miami. People\nbelieve they are missing out, that\neveryone else has this great and\nexciting life and they don’t. I\nmean, we all have to get dressed,\nfeed the kids, get our driver's\nlicence renewed, look up what time\nthe afternoon matinee starts, lose\nourselves in entertainment, lose\nourselves in sex, routine, getting\na little too drunk, buying a\npresent for someone you don’t like\nvery much - you feel guilty about\nnot liking them, so you spend a\nlittle too much money.\n\nCELINE\nSo, it’s like a National Geographic\nprogram on people.\n\nJESSE\nExactly.\n\f11.\n\nCELINE\nI can see it: twenty-four boring\nhours and a three-minute sex scene\nwhere he falls asleep right after.\n\nJESSE\nExactly. And that would be an\nexciting episode. Maybe you and\nyour friends can do one of those\nepisodes from Paris. The key to\nmaking this work would be in the\ndistribution.

I actually saw her a\ncouple of hours before we ever\ntalked, as I was finding a seat.\nShe had her foot up on the seat\nacross from her and didn’t notice\nme at all as I passed by her. Then\nlater, there was this weirdo couple\nfighting near her, and she moved\nback and happened to sit right\nacross the aisle from me. We began\nto talk. I don’t think she really\nliked me at the beginning. She is\nso smart and passionate and\nbeautiful - I felt so unsure of\nmyself. I felt everything I was\nsaying was stupid macho stuff.\n\nCELINE\n\nOh, man, I wouldn’t worry. I’m\nsure she was not judging you. And\nby the way, she decided to sit next\nto you. I’m sure she did it on\npurpose. Us men are stupid. We\nnever understand women. They act\nstrange, the little I know of them.\n\nEXT.",

A serious-looking guy\nwalks by carrying a bag.\n\nJESSE\nSee that guy? We’ll never see him\nagain. That was the one moment our\nlives intersect.\n\nThe guy suddenly turns and walks back the other way.\n\nCELINE\nI always wonder about things like\nthat. Like, think of the bag he is\ncarrying. I wonder what is in it.\nIf you think he’s carrying a bomb\nto blow up the opera because he\nfailed his audition for Don Juan,\nthen his serious expression becomes\nthis angry, vicious face.\n\n(MORE )\n\f57.\n\nCELINE (CONT'D)\nBut if you imagine in his bag is a\npresent for his young, dying wife,\nthen he becomes this poor,\nsympathetic character who you want\nto give a big hug to.\n\nJESSE\nHmmm.\n\nCeline indicates a young art-student-looking woman.\n\nCELINE\nShe's thinking about a TV show she\nsaw yesterday on strippers, and\neven though all her friends were\ndisgusted by it, she’s thinking\nabout giving up her low-paying\noffice job and giving it a try.\n\nA nerdy guy walks by.\n\nJESSE\nThat guy over there...rejected by\nScientology.

We’ll die in the\nmorning?\n\nCELINE\n\nI think it’s the only way. I don’t\nwant to cheapen what’s special\nabout our time together. If we\npush for something more, it’s like\nwe're trying to commodify ourselves\nor something.\n\f36\n\n61.\n\nJESSE\nOkay, no delusions. No\nprojections. Let’s just make the\nrest of tonight great.",

ACTIVE STREET - NIGHT 36\n\nCeline and Jesse walk down a fairly busy street near some\nnightclubs. They come across a crowd gathered around a woman\ndancing, and the rhythmic sound of finger cymbals can be\nheard. Sitting on the ground is a man playing a dumbek who\nbeats out a mesmerizing rhythm. Celine grabs Jesse’s arm\nwith a look of excitement and rushes toward the crowd,\nfinding a good vantage point to watch the Middle Eastern\ndancer. The dancer performs in an exciting and unusual way\nand elicits a positive reaction from the crowd. At the end\nof the performance Celine places a couple of bills in the\ntambourine that sits on the sidewalk near the dancer’s shoes.\nThen she and Jesse proceed down the street as the crowd\ndisperses. Celine is obviously moved by the dance.\n\nCELINE\nI saw a documentary on that stuff -\nIt’s a birth dance.\n\nJESSE\nA birth dance? How does that work?\n\nCELINE\nWomen used it when giving birth.\nIn some parts of the world they\nstill do it. The woman in labor\nenters a tent and the women of her\ntribe surround her and dance using\ntheir torsos and pelvises, and they\nencourage the birthing woman to\ndance with them so as to make the\nbirth less painful. And after the\nbaby is born, they all dance in\ncelebration.\n\f62.\n\nJESSE\nWow. My mom would have never gone\nfor that.\n\nCELINE\n\nBut it’s a really primal dance.\nThey think that women have usually\ndone it mainly for other women as\nsome kind of fertility ritual.\n\nJESSE\nThat’s cool.\n\nCELINE\nIt’s a beautiful thing. I like the\nidea of dance as being a common\nfunction of life, something that\neveryone participates in.\n\nJESSE\n\nI know. I heard about this old man\nwatching a bunch of young people\ndancing.

Okay, speaking\nseriously here.\n(MORE )\n\f63.\n\nCELINE (CONT'D)\nI mean, I feel this pressure to be\na strong and independent icon of\nwomanhood and not have it look like\nmy life is only revolving around\nsome guy, but the love of a man and\nreturning that love means a lot to\nme. I always make fun of it and\nstuff, but isn’t everything we're\ndoing in life a way to be loved a\nlittle more or something?\n\nJESSE\nSometimes I dream of being a good\nfather and a good husband.\nSometimes that feels really close,\nbut other times it just seems\nsilly, and that it would ruin my\nlife. It’s not that I have a fear\nof commitment or I’m incapable of\nloving or caring about someone\nelse, because I can. It’s just\nthat if I’m totally honest with\nmyself, I’d rather die knowing that\nI was really good at something,\nthat I was special or had excelled\nin some way, than to have only been\nin a really nice, caring\nrelationship.\n\nCELINE\n\nYou know, I had worked for this\nolder man, and once he told me that\nhe had spent all his life thinking\nabout his career and his work, and\nhow he was fifty-two and it\nsuddenly struck him that he had\nnever really given anything of\nhimself, that his life was for no\none and nothing.

DANCE CLUB - NIGHT 37\n\nThey enter a small, almost desolate disco where on couple is\ndancing and a few others are sitting around - the up-all-\nnight crowd. They split up and he goes over to the BARTENDER\nand starts talking to him, pleading with him. She goes over\nto an empty table and subtly takes two glasses. Across the\nroom, he’s made a little headway with the gruff, older\nbartender, who eventually relents and hands him a bottle of\nwine. Suddenly Lou Christie’s “Lightnin’ Strikes” comes over\nthe speakers and Jesse hams it up as he crosses the dance\nfloor on his way back to meet her at the door. He tries to\nget into it and has a little success.\n\nEXT. PARK - NIGHT 38\n\nLater, they are sitting in a remote area of the park, pouring\nglasses from their bottle of wine.\n\nCELINE\nSo often in my life I’ve been with\npeople and shared beautiful moments\nlike traveling or staying up all\nnight and watching the sunrise, and\nI knew it was a special moment, but\nsomething was always wrong.

The\nHARPSICHORD PLAYER’s entire room is decorated in a\nseventeenth-to eightenth-century fashion with wood-plank\nfloors, old furniture, and paintings. Together with the\nbeautiful and intense music, it is a stunning view - a living\nportrait. They sort of look at each other occasionally but\nsay nothing.
