  "1": "THE INTERN\nby\n\nNancy Meyers\n\nJanuary 2014\n\fFADE IN:\n\nEXT. PROSPECT PARK —- BROOKLYN - AN EARLY SPRING MORNING\n\nAn eclectic Group ranging in age from 30 to 80 gather in rows\nperforming the ancient Chinese martial art of TAI CHI. They\nare led by their young and graceful Instructor. CAMERA\nGLIDES PAST one student to the next, as they move in sync\nthrough their meditative poses. CREDITS BEGIN.\n\nBEN (V.O.)\nFreud said, “Love and work, work\nand love. That’s all there is.”\nWell, I’m retired and my wife is\ndead.\n\nAnd on that, we ARRIVE on BEN WHITTAKER. Ben just turned\nSeventy, an Everyman in many ways, but a unique man to all\nwho know him. He exhales as he turns in sync with the others.\n\nBEN (V.O.)\n-- As you can imagine, that has\ngiven me some time on my hands.\n\nINT. BEN’S HOUSE - BROOKLYN - NIGHT\n\nBEN, wearing a suit and tie, sits in an upright chair in his\ncomfortable brownstone, TALKING TO CAMERA. Looks like he’s\non VIDEO.\n\nBEN\nMy wife’s been gone for three-and-a-\nhalf years. I miss her in every\nway. And retirement -- that is an\nongoing, relentless effort in\ncreativity. At first, I admit, I\nenjoyed the novelty of it. Sort of\nfelt like I was playing hooky.\n\nEXT. JFK TARMAC - NEW YORK CITY - DAY\nA jumbo jet lifts off.\nBEN V.O.\n\nI used all the miles I had saved\nand traveled the globe.\n\fINT. BEN’S BROWNSTONE - BROOKLYN - NIGHT\n\nBen ENTERS in an overcoat, carrying his suitcase and wearing\na purple lei around his neck. He stands for a moment in his\nquiet, empty house.\n\nBEN V.O.\nProblem was, no matter where I\nwent, as soon as I got home, the\nnowhere to be thing hit me like a\nton of bricks.\n\nEXT.

Get up,\nget out of the house and go\nsomewhere. Anywhere.\n\nINT. PARK SLOPE STARBUCKS - MORNING\n\nCrowded with folks on their way to work. Ben sits on a stool\nat a corner table with a bagel and the morning’s Post.\n\nBEN V.O.\nCome rain or shine, I’m at my\nStarbucks by 7:15. Can’t explain\nit, but it makes me feel part of\nsomething.\n\nTwo Male Execs in their 40's, ask Ben if they can share his\ntable. Ben’s delighted, moves his papers. The Guys take the\ntwo remaining stools, turn them away from Ben and begin an\nimpromptu meeting -- as if Ben wasn’t even there.\n\nINT. BEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT\nBen to CAMERA.\n\nBEN\n\nHow do I spend the rest of my days?\nYou name it. Golf, movies, books,\npinochle, tried yoga, learned to\ncook, bought some plants, took\nclasses in Mandarin.\n\n(SPEAKS MANDARIN)\nTranslation? Believe me, I’ve tried\neverything.\n\fINT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY\n\nBen walks the center aisle between the pews. Many of his\nfriends sit around him. He pats a back or two as he looks\nfor an empty seat.\n\nBEN V.O.\nAnd then of course, there are the\nfunerals. So many more than I could\nimagine.\n\nAs Ben looks for a seat, a cute number about Ben’s age, PATTY\nPOMERANTZ, smiles at him, hoping he’1ll sit next to her. Just\nthen, Ben spots his friend, MILES, who shows him he saved him\na seat. Ben smiles back at Patty but joins Miles, who shakes\nhis head at their deceased friend, lying before them. Ben\nlooks at his friend, tears quickly welling in his eyes.\n\nCLOSE - AN OPEN SUITCASE\n\nOn Ben’s BED. Ben places TWO GIFTS wrapped in Toy Store\nwrapping paper on top of his clothes, zips his bag shut.\n\nBEN (V.0)\nThe only traveling I do these days\nis out to San Diego to visit my son\nand his family.",

As CAMERA CONTINUES TO BOOM DOWN we find Ben wide awake\nin the bottom bunk under Dora the Explorer sheets.\n\nBEN (V.0)\nDon’t get me wrong. I’m not an\nunhappy person. Quite the contrary.\nI just know there’s a hole in my\nlife and I need to fill it.\n\nBen TURNS TOWARD CAMERA, turns out a small lamp and the\nSCREEN goes BLACK.\n\nBEN (V.O.)\nSoon.\n\fEXT.
