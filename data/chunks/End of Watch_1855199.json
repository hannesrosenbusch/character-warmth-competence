We follow their lives over a period of\nseveral months as they fall in love, have children, get married and otherwise live their lives. The\nfilm also has a strong crime story and plenty of action of great scope. It is a film that will have\nsomething for everyone and touch upon universal themes of friendship, love, honor and courage.\nThese are real people leading real lives.\n\nToday’s young people create and consume video media in very different ways. They film their daily\nlives and share these videos through social media. It is this novel use of video and the intimacy of\nreality that I wish to emulate. This film will be shot in many of the same ways that young people\ncreate media today.",
  "3": "END OF PREVIOUSLY ANNOTATED SECTION:\nThey film their daily\nlives and share these videos through social media. It is this novel use of video and the intimacy of\nreality that I wish to emulate. This film will be shot in many of the same ways that young people\ncreate media today. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\n My concept is simple: The characters themselves are placing and operating the\ncameras. This creates a very visceral reality, much like watching real dramatic action on the\nInternet. One could term this method “French New Wave Cinema meets You Tube.”\n\nOften “found footage” films are difficult to watch due to excessive camera movement. Please keep\nin mind that these will not be shaky, unsteady “Cloverfield” type images. “End of Watch” will be shot\nin anormal theatrical resolution using many standard production techniques. Image quality will be\nhigh, the colors will be vibrant and beautiful. The shots will be incredibly lyrical and smooth.\nAlthough the actors will be wearing cameras, the images produced will be much like typical\nSteadicam shots, with the same grace and beauty, although from angles before unachievable.\n\n1 am working with camera manufacturers to develop new cameras that will capture the images of\ntheatrical level quality yet be very small and compact. The extremely small, yet full resolution\ncameras will be able to record the drama and action in ways that have not been possible before. In\nsuccess these new cameras will be nothing short of revolutionary. I believe the techniques used\nwill be groundbreaking unto themselves and will become an important talking point in the release\nof the film. Of course there will also be standard camera coverage; my intent is to use all tools\navailable to tell this wonderful story. This film will be beautiful, clearly shot and will immerse the\nviewer in it’s world in an intimate way.\n\n“End of Watch” will deliver an exciting and fresh viewing experience for audiences of all\nbackgrounds. There will be nuanced and powerful performances by some of the best actors\nworking today. The audience will see police as they have never seen them, the journey will be\nvibrant, fun and exciting. It will have the entertainment value of a “popcorn movie” yet deliver the\ndepth and sophistication of a powerful drama. I hope you enjoy the script and come on this\nfilmmaking journey with me.\n\nKind regards,\nDavid Ayer\nLos Angeles, California\n\fTHE SCREEN IS BLACK.
