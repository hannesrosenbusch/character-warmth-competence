We HEAR someone\n\n            clearing congested lungs, coughing up phlegm; a slight crash\n\n            STOPS both the cough and the alarm.\n\n\n\n            EXT. GEORGE'S BEACH SHACK - MORNING\n\n\n\n            The cottage is a tiny, peeling paint rat-trap set dead center\n\n            on a small ocean front cul-de-sac, surrounded by four massive\n\n            post-modern mansions.\n\n\n\n            INT. GEORGE'S BEACH SHACK BEDROOM - MORNING\n\n\n\n            GEORGE NELSON, 42, squints and shivers as the spotty morning\n\n            light and ocean breeze enter through an open window.  Bold\n\n            waves crash against the cliffs outside the room.  A five-foot\n\n            wide stack of hand hewed beams are piled pyramid style,\n\n            making movement in the room next to impossible.  George\n\n            stands shirtless in underwear and coughs again.  He steps\n\n            over a pile of tools and stands at the window, facing the\n\n            sea.  A happy sounding tune by Guster, \"WHAT YOU WISH FOR,\"\n\n            begins with the lyrics: 'Woke up today, to everything gray\n\n            and all that I saw just keeps going on and on...'\n\n\n\n            EXT. WEBBER'S HOUSE - MORNING\n\n\n\n            The post-modern house is three-levels of concrete and glass.\n\n\n\n            INT. SAM WEBBER'S BEDROOM - MORNING\n\n\n\n            SAM is sixteen with spiky black hair, a nose ring, two\n\n            earrings and painted black nails.  The song continues with:\n\n            '...sweep all the pieces under the bed, close all the\n\n            curtains and cover my head.'  Sam looks wasted as he climbs\n\n            out of bed and rummages through his dresser, retrieving an\n\n            empty bottle of prescription drugs; he tosses the bottle.  He\n\n            walks to a desk where a half-built model of a house sits\n\n            unfinished and squeezes glue into a plastic bag and sniffs\n\n            it.",

He\n\n            slips his neck through the noose and lowers his body; though\n\n            we don't see exactly what he's doing below his neck, it's\n\n            evident through his jerking arm that he's masturbating.\n\n\n\n            EXT. BECK'S OCEAN FRONT MANSION - MORNING\n\n\n\n            COLLEEN BECK, George's next-door neighbor, is a well\n\n            maintained blonde in her late thirties.  She walks out of the\n\n            angular concrete mansion, grabs the paper and walks back in.\n\n\n\n            INT. BECK'S KITCHEN - MORNING\n\n\n\n            This is a minimalist kitchen, with pored concrete walls and\n\n            stainless steel cabinets. \n\n            Colleen drops the paper on the table and walks to the sink to\n\n            wash her hands.  The SONG CONTINUES: '...If this serenade is\n\n            not what you want, it's just how it is...'  Colleen appears\n\n            distracted for a moment.  She walks outside onto the terrace\n\n            with wet hands, then bolts back in, breezing through the\n\n            kitchen with purpose.\n\n\n\n            INT. ALYSSA BECK'S BATHROOM - MORNING\n\n\n\n            ALYSSA is sixteen and perfect with strawberry blonde hair and\n\n            white teeth; her head is partially out the bathroom window. \n\n            Colleen bursts in, eases Alyssa aside and with effort, sticks\n\n            her head out of the same high open window.\n\n\n\n                                COLLEEN\n\n                      This is ridiculous!\n\n\n\n            We must not see exactly what they see, but out the window and\n\n            almost beyond view, a stream of urine arks out from George\n\n            Nelson's beach house bedroom, into the pacific ocean some\n\n            twenty-feet below.  The piss stops.  Colleen bangs her head\n\n            trying to get it back inside the house.\n\n\n\n            INT. WEBBER'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MORNING\n\n\n\n            ROBIN WEBBER is George's ex-wife, still beautiful at forty. \n\n            She herds two boys, RYAN (8) and ADAM (7), down the hall.",

The song continues: '...come out come\n\n            out, wherever you are, would you do it all over right from\n\n            the start, and what you wish for won't come true, you aren't\n\n            surprised to love, are you?' \n\n\n\n            Robin stops at the door, trying to figure out why her son is\n\n            sitting in a pile of his own clothes.  Ryan and Adam join\n\n            her, looking equally perplexed.\n\n\n\n            EXT. GEORGE NELSON'S CUL-DE-SAC - MORNING\n\n\n\n            George's dog, GUSTER, is doing his business on the lawn of a\n\n            modern day robber baron, DAVID DOKOS, who exits his house\n\n            with a briefcase.  He hops into his Mercedes and proceeds to\n\n            chase Guster straight across his well-manicured grass. \n\n            Guster easily escapes death and runs off.  George walks out\n\n            of his shack as David hops the curb, flips him off and drives\n\n            away.  George waves goodbye.\n\n\n\n                                GEORGE\n\n                      Stick it up your ass!

Rather than offices, most of the space is open,\n\n            segmented only by portable low walls.  Along the outer walls,\n\n            below the long line of windows, is a shelf filled with\n\n            amazingly intricate models.

GEORGE'S SHACK - MORNING\n\n\n\n            George is prying off the last of the boards when he's hit\n\n            with a pain that takes him to his knees.  He drops the\n\n            crowbar and sits down in the dirt as Guster walks over to\n\n            comfort him.  George takes deep breaths and closes his eyes\n\n            as he tries to gain control over the pain.\n\n\n\n            INT. ALYSSA'S BATHROOM - MORNING\n\n\n\n            The doorknob jiggles, jiggles and turns; Alyssa opens the\n\n            door and walks in dressed in a t-shirt and panties.  Once\n\n            again Sam jumps and jams his elbow to the frosted glass as he\n\n            partially opens the shower door.\n\n\n\n                                SAM\n\n                      Is this like a past time with people?

Alyssa takes off her t-shirt and pulls down\n\n            her panties before grabbing a towel; she hands it to Sam as\n\n            she forces her way into the shower.  Barely visible through\n\n            the frosted glass, Alyssa wets her hair as Sam stares in her\n\n            direction.  The towel drops to the tiled floor.\n\n\n\n            INT.

Much, much worse.\n\n\n\n            Robin waits to see how worse.  George finally walks to her\n\n            and takes her in his arms.  He must have been better than\n\n            this.  The waltz smooths out as they dance closer, holding\n\n            tighter.  \"We fill the air with silent stares.
