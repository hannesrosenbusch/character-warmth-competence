  "1": "NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD\n\fCredit: Written by\nAuthor: GEORGE A. ROMERO and JOHN A. RUSSO\n\nDraft date: Copyright 1968 by George A. Romero and John A.\nRusso\n\nEXT. CEMETERY - DUSK\n\nIt is an ordinary dusk of normal quiet and shadow. The\ngray sky contains a soft glow from the recent sun, so that\ntrees and long blades of grass seem to shimmer in the\ngathering night. There is a rasp of crickets, and the\nrustle of leaves in an occasional whispering breeze.\n\nTransitions are easy and gradual, with relaxed studies of\nearth, grass and leafy branches on a high-mounded hill.\nRevelation of cemetery markers does nothing to disrupt the\npeacefulness of our established mood; when awareness comes,\nit is almost as though we have known where we were all\nalong. We are in a typical rural cemetery, conceivably\nadjacent to a small church\n\nAlthough the presence of a church is felt rather than\nconfirmed. The stones range from small identifying slates\nto monuments of careful design..an occasional Franciscan\nCrucifix, or a carved image of a defending angel. Over a\nhundred years of death indicated in stones syllabic with\ntheir year and the status of the families they represent.\n\nOver the other night sounds is added the gravel-rumble of a\nslow-moving car. A wider shot reveals the car and the\nmounded cemetery, as the car pulls into the gate and moves\ndown one of the cemetery roads, the car passes in extreme\nforeground and moves away from the camera. In the breeze\nof its passing, the dead leaves that clutter the little\nroad swirl and move.\n\fBeyond the distant trees, the last receding gray of dusk in\nsurrendering to the black. The car continues. When the car\nstops, we feel the absence of its sounds..replaced by the\ncrickets and the subtle wind. Even as the car is still\nrocking slightly form its stopping action, we cut to a shot\nthrough the driver window at the occupants of the car. The\nDRIVER is a young man in his mid-twenties, and his\nPASSENGER is a young woman, his sister. The man is in\nshirtsleeves with a loosened tie.",

The man is in\nshirtsleeves with a loosened tie. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\n His suit-coat is on the\nclothing hook over the back seat. The girl is wearing a\nsimple but attractive summer suit, with the jacket removed\nand folded on her lap. She is fussing with her purse,\nwhile the man shuts off engine, lights, and leans back to\nyawn and stretch his legs. The girl closes a potato chip\nbag, brushes crumbs, fluffs her hair ... typical feminine\ngestures after a long ride. The man stretches again.\n\nBARBARA\nThey ought to make the day the\ntime changes the first day of\nsummer. Then two good things\nwould happen all at once.\n\nA little laugh from the man as he straightens his tie.\n\nBARBARA\nI love the long days and the extra\nsun.\n\nJOHN\n\nA lot of good the extra daylight\ndoes me. i lost an hour’s sleep.\nAnd it’s dark already, and we\nstill have a three-hour drive, and\nwe won’t get back till after\nmidnight.\n\nBarbara reaches down to put her shoes on.\n\nBARBARA\nIf it really dragged you that\nmuch, you wouldn’t do it.\n\nJOHN\nAre you kidding? I certainly\ndon’t want to blow sunday on this\nscene. We’re gonna either have to\nmove mother to Parkville or move\nthe grave to pittsburgh.\n\fBARBARA\nOh, you’re just being silly.\nMother can’t make a drive like\nthis.\n\nJohn reaches to the back seat and produces a flowered,\ncross-shaped grave ornament. In the center of the cross, in\ngold script on a red field, is written “We Still Remember”\n\nJOHN\nLook, twenty-five dollars ... “We\nStill Remember”... I don’t, you\nknow it ... I don’t remember what\n\nthe guy looks like.\n\nBARBARA\nJohnny ... it takes you five\nminutes.\n\nJOHN\nThree hours... no, six hours\n\nsix hours and five minutes.\n\nBarbara continues to primp and straighten her outfit.

It is an unkept grave, its outline cropped and\novergrown with grass and wilted flowers. John takes the\nflowered cross and, stepping close to the headstone, embeds\nits wire-prong base into the earth, as he rambles on.\n\nJOHN\nWonder what happened to the one\nfrom last year? Every year\ntwenty-five bucks for one of these\nthings, and the one from last year\nis gone....\n\nWe hear Barbara’s voice.

John\nstraightens his tie and buttons his jacket. He steps\nbehind his sister, puts his hands in his pockets, and rocks\nnervously on one foot. She continues to pray. John looks\naround the cemetery.\n\nThe stones are soft and white... they seem very pale.\nThere are a few moving shadows. The sounds of the night\nseem louder, but this is only because they have stopped\ntalking. The situation does not seem ominous. John is\nmerely bored. In the distance, a huddled figure is walking\namong the graves.\n\nJOHN\n(Glancing at his watch)\nC'mon, Barb, church was this\nmorning...\n\nThe girl continues her prayers. John lights a cigarette,\nidly exhales the first puff of smoke and looks around\nagain.\n\nThe huddled figure still moves slowly among the graves.\nJohn turns to his sister and is about to say something but\nsees her making the sign of the cross and dropping her\nbeads in her purse.

Up the path, beyond the intersection of\nthe man’s row. John stops, laughing, and turns to look\nback at his sister. She is near the place where the paths\nmeet, and so is the old man. We cut close to her. She is\nlooking down in embarrassed silence, aware of her proximity\nwith the old man. She feigns poise, and as she makes the\nintersection looks up nervously to deliver a socially\nnecessary smile to the old mourner...\n\fThe old man lunges at the girl, his hand grabs at her\nhair. A frightened gasp chokes her. She is coughing. The\nman grips her arm and slashes at her clothing. She flails\nabout choking trying to yell....\n\nJOHN\n(Horrified)\nHey... god...\n\nThe man is all over Barbara, unable to hold her in her\nviolent flailing. His grabbing tears her jacket and\nscratches her face. He seems to be trying to bite her arm.\n\nJohn leaps at the man. The three fall to the ground,\nBarbara kicking, and beating with her purse. John gets a\nfirm hold on the man and Barbara is able to wrench free.\nThe man is thrashing wildly at all parts of John’s body.\nThey struggle to their feet, the figure thrashes, beats,\ntears like an animal... John clutches at him and they fall\nin a heap. In the darkness, their form is as one thrashing\nthing.\n\nBarbara screams wildly. The two men make animal sounds.\nOne figure gains the advantage and slams his fists down\nagainst the other’s head. Barbara is panic-stricken. Her\nscreams turn to frenzied gasps as she finds a tree limb and\nsnatches it up. But when she looks up, she sees that one\nhas vanquished the other. She stops in her tracks. Night\nsounds. A close shot makes it clear that John is lying\nlimply on the ground with the other man hunched over his\nform.

He steps over the body.\n\nBarbara drops the club and breaks into a dead run down the\npath. She screams. The man moves after her, but he is\nconsiderably slower that she, with seeming difficulty in\nmoving. He appears almost crippled.\n\f10.\n\nIn a flailing run, Barbara reaches the car, sobbing. She\nyanks open the door. She can hear the man drawing nearer.\nShe scrambles into the front seat and slams the door\n\nshut ... No key. The man draws nearer, seeming to move\nfaster, more desperate to reach the girl. Barbara sobs\n\nshe clenches the steering wheel. The driver’s window is\nopen, she struggles to roll it up ... then pushes the lock\nbutton. The man is upon the car. Barbara dives across the\nseat to slam down the passenger-side lock button.

Pounding...\nClawing ... he grabs a stone from the road ... the\npassenger window shatters into thousands of little cracks.\nAnother pound sends the stone through the window, and hands\ngrab through the opening to peel away the flakes of glass\nin sections.

The beams\nreveal the grade in the road, which is narrowing to one car\nwidth, and, about two hundred feet ahead, the downhill\ngrade ends and an uphill grade begins. In desperation, the\ngirl looks out the rear window. Against the sky, in the\nlight from the cemetery gate, the man is still coming after\nthem. In panic, she looks about. She is still in the\ncemetery proper. Rows of graves on both sides of the\n\nroad. No lights from houses, no signs of life. The car\nslows. It’s momentum carries it some distance up the\nupgrade.

The man is still after her. She reaches\na low stone wall which marks the end of the cemetery. She\nstruggles over it and looks ahead for a moment to get her\nbearings. Across a main highway is a darkened gasoline\nstation, and beyond it an old house. She pants heavily,\nglancing up and down the highway ... but there is no sigh\nof traffic.

Across the\nhighway, she sees her pursuer struggle over the little\nwall, and in his clumsiness fall groveling on the ground.\nIn panic, she runs to the rear of the house and into the\nshadows of a small back porch. Her first impulse is to cry\nout for help, but she silences herself in favor of trying\nto stay hidden. She gasps, trying to hold her breath.\nSilence ... night sounds ... and the sounds of the man’s\nfunning footsteps slowing to a trot ... then a walk ... the\nfootsteps stop.\n\nBarbara quickly glances about. There is a rear window. She\npeers through it, but inside everything is dark. The\npursuing footsteps take up again. She presses back against\nthe door of the house, and her hand falls on the doorknob.\nShe looks down at it, grabs it with a turn, and the door\nopens. She enters quickly, as quietly as possible, and\ncloses the door softly behind her, bolting it and feeling\nin the darkness for a key.

She leans\nagainst the door, listening, and can still hear the distant\nfootfalls.\n\f12.\n\nBarbara finds that she is in the kitchen of the old house.\nShe gropes through a door and into a large living room\n\nno sign of life.
