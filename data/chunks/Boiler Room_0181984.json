A good broker makes \n                    over seven hundred calls a day.\n\n                              SETH\n                        (laughs)\n                    What's the phone bill like here?\n\n                              GREG\n                    This month was approaching four hundred \n                    thousand.

GREG\n                    Okay, first of all there are going to \n                    be a lot of those regardless of how \n                    good you are. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n  But you happen to suck \n                    dick.  I have this friend who runs this \n                    other firm.  He gives out this book to \n                    all his trainees.  The Rebuttal Book.  \n                    Looks like a fil-o-fax.  Has those \n                    index tabs but they don't say A to B to \n                    G to H, they say things like Wife won't \n                    let me, I'm not in the market now, Call \n                    me back, Send me a prospectus.  \n                    Has a rebuttal for any excuse.  That's \n                    all the shit you're gonna have to learn \n                    later.  For now you only have to \n                    remember one thing.  You can be whoever \n                    you want on the phone.  So say what you \n                    have to.  Use a different name if you \n                    want.  Tell them you're a vice-\n                    president here.  Just get them on the \n                    line.  That's the first step.  It's the \n                    hardest part sometimes, but just get \n                    the cocksucker on the line.\n\n                              SETH\n                    I don't understand.

The only \n                    compliance work he's doing is making \n                    sure my lunch is still hot when it gets \n                    here.  He's only here because the SEC \n                    requires it.  He might have the easiest \n                    fucking job in the entire world.

It's \n                    actually going to be the biggest month \n                    we've ever had.  We've got a new issue \n                    I want to talk to you about.  It's \n                    called Med Patent.  They've just \n                    designed the world's first retractable \n                    syringe.  This means that doctors and \n                    nurses will never again have to worry \n                    about infection from dirty needles. \n                    This is not going to be an alternative \n                    in the medical world, it's going to be \n                    the standard.  We all know we're here \n                    to make money, but if we can do \n                    something good like this, then all the \n                    better.  So I want you all to go out \n                    and buy yourselves a new car, or a \n                    house.  Whatever you want.  Go into \n                    debt.

It's so \n                    simple.  A group of investors make a \n                    loan to a private company.  Let's say \n                    for three million.  After the company \n                    gets taken public they pay back a \n                    million in cash and the other two they \n                    pay back in common stock, but at the \n                    IPO price.  So the investors basically \n                    get two million worth of IPO stock.  \n                    Then they can sell it on the open \n                    market at triple what they bought it \n                    for.  Now that's actually all legal as \n                    long as the investors are not tied to \n                    the brokerage house.  But Michael's \n                    friends are the investors on every IPO \n                    we do.\n\n                              DEBBIE\n                    That's why all the names were the same \n                    on the contracts.\n\n                              SETH\n                    Right.  Then he has us push it all on \n                    the open market.  We're selling \n                    Michael's shares.  That's where the two \n                    dollar rips come in.
