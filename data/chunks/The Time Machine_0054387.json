Then a sound...\n\fClick-clack, click-clack, click-clack...\nThe familiar sound of chalk writing on a blackboard.\nFade up to see...\n\nA hand zooming across a blackboard at incredible speed,\nforming an endless algebraic equation.\n\nAmazingly, when the writer reaches the end of the blackboard\nhe does not lift the chalk and return to the left side to\nbegin a new line -- instead he simply loops around and\ncontinues writing, right to left, upside down.\n\nThe college students in his class -- all male and dressed in\nlate Victorian clothes -- smile at this familiar peculiarity\nand tilt their heads to try and read the endless equation,\ncopying furiously into notebooks.\n\nThe hand continues to zoom along the blackboard... and then\nslows... and then stops... the students wait... the hand taps\nthe chalk on the blackboard for a moment and we finally\nsee...\n\nALEXANDER HARTDEGEN, a handsome young man not much older than\nhis students, standing at the blackboard. He is gazing out a\nwindow, looking at a bird on a tree branch. He smiles.\n\nThe students glance to one another.\n\nAlexander remembers himself and turns back to the blackboard,\nhis hand again flying as:\n\nALEXANDER\nSo -- length, width, breadth --\nformulate the area and of course we\narrive at solid mass. But imagine\nif we continue the equation as I've\ndone -- can't we begin to recognize\nanother dimension beyond the first\nthree? I theorize we begin to find\nduration -- the object's place in\ntime. Let's note that as \"D\"\nhere...\n\n \n\nAlexander reaches the left side of the blackboard and loops\naround again in an unbroken line to continue the equation\nfrom left to right again.\n\nThe students are hopelessly lost. They finally stop copying\nand just watch Alexander work, admiring his brilliant\ninnovation.\n\nMeanwhile, a man watches from the back of the lecture hall.\nHe is DAVID PHILBY, Alexander's closest friend, a bit older.\n\fALEXANDER\n..",
