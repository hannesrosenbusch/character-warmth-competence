IRANIAN BUS - AFTERNOON\nCamera powers up, jostles around until it settles on --\n\nThe floor of a third world bus. Middle Eastern legs,\ntraditional Arabian dresses to the floor, homemade bags,\nanimals everywhere. A chaotic scene with men, women, children\nall shouting in Farsi. Brief glimpses of a mountainous\nlandscape through the shaky windows. This bus could really\nuse some new shocks and a better muffler.\n\nThe camera rises, turns around revealing its operator, a\nWOMAN wearing a hajib (a traditional Arabian headdress). She\nslumps low in her seat for privacy, looks around cautiously,\nand carefully lowers her veil revealing --\n\nSCARLETT DURANG, mid 20s, an adventurous British\narchaeologist. The kind of cat that gets killed by curiosity.\nHer off-the-charts intellect and multiple post-grad degrees\nare barely concealed by her striking good looks and punk rock\ninclinations.\n\nJudging from the cloth that edges frame, she is obviously\nshooting with a small camera attached to her hajib.\n\nShe whispers to the camera - alert, but not scared.\n\nSCARLETT\nI'm approximately 20 miles inside\nthe Iranian border en route to the\nHabala region where they have\nordered the destruction of a\nnetwork of caves at sundown\ntonight. I believe these caves\nmight contain a critical missing\npiece of our history. A piece I\ncan’t let them destroy.\n\nShe turns the camera back around, then pauses and goes back\nto her face.\n\nSCARLETT (CONT’D)\nOh, and if I’m found dead, please\nknow I entered the country of my\nown free will, fully knowing the\npenalty for trespassing here is\nburial up to your neck in sand and\nhaving a rock wall pushed on top of\nyou. Which, you know, seems\nperfectly appropriate.\n\nShe grins mischievously.\n\fSCARLETT (CONT’D)\nBut they’1l have to catch me first.\nEXT.
