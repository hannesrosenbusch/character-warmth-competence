UPPER WEST SIDE SCHOOL/CLASSROOM - DAY                   1\n\n\n\n    Loud conversation, laughter, singing, and even dancing: the\n\n    teacher is missing in a 7th Grade classroom. This rare\n\n    absence of authority is intensely enjoyed by the crowd. It\n\n    looks like it's party time for these KIDS.\n\n\n\n    They talk and laugh, show each other photos on their phones,\n\n    draw spaceships and baboons on their notebooks, and fold\n\n    pieces of paper into airplanes that fly around the room.\n\n\n\n    In a corner, a GROUP OF GIRLS dance to the tune of a song\n\n    they are listening to on headphones.\n\n\n\n    On the other side of the room, TWO BOYS play like in a sword\n\n    fight, without swords.\n\n\n\n    Suddenly, someone turns out the lights. There's random\n\n    shouting and laughter.\n\n\n\n    An overhead projector is turned on, and a couple of the kids\n\n    start to make puppet figures that are seen on the white\n\n    screen.\n\n\n\n    A door opens, and a voice is heard, grave and authoritative.\n\n\n\n                        MR. PLUMMER (O.S.)\n\n              What is going on here?!\n\n\n\n    The kids scramble back to their seats as the lights go on.\n\n    MR. PLUMMER, the teacher, has come in.\n\n\n\n                        MR. PLUMMER\n\n              What is this mess?? Didn't you\n\n              promise me to be quiet? Can't I\n\n              even leave you alone for five\n\n              minutes?? Lionel, sit down. Sit\n\n              down, I said! Melissa, put your\n\n              phone away. Put it away right now!\n\n              I asked you to be quiet, and...\n\n              look at you. What a disappointment.\n\n\n\n    Mr. Plummer wanders around the classroom, inspecting\n\n    everyone. Each kid has a different reaction. Some are\n\n    frightened, others think it's funny. Some are respectful, and\n\n    some others, defiant.\n\n\n\n    The teacher stops by a desk that's covered by a VERY COLORFUL\n\n    DRAWING, while the STUDENT rushes to put away his large\n\n    collection of Caran d'Ache pencils neatly in the box.\n\n\n\n                        MR.",

Girls cover their\n\nmouths not to laugh out loud. Jake blushes, his eyes fill up\n\nwith quiet, angry tears; he wasn't even talking to anyone,\n\nhe was just drawing, doing his thing.
