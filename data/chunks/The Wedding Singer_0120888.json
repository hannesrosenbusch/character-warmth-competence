When I got the baby-sitter\npregnant...\n\n...a goofy uncle with a video camera, guests kicking each\nother under the table, bridesmaids rolling their eyes and the\nBRIDE, looking distressed. Finally, as the toast reaches a\nsort of crescendo of pointlessness, the camera comes to rest\non the GROOM, his eyes narrowed in dull hate.\n\nThe groom stands up, and the camera follows him across the\n\nfloor as he walks over to the bandstand.
