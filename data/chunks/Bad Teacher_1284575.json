We waved to each\n\n          other at the carwash. I'm a little\n\n          concerned with the importance you're\n\n          placing on movies. What about the state\n\n          test?\n\n          Elizabeth points to her sign on the wall -- \"Don't\n\n          Question My Authority.\"\n\n\n\n                         ELIZABETH\n\n          That's exactly what I say to my students.\n\n          Listen, I'm a good teacher. And the school\n\n          hired me because I'm good at what I do.\n\n          (as the parents take this in)\n\n          And the reason your son loves my class is\n\n          because I inspire him. Movies are one\n\n          tool that I use. I also use other\n\n          multimedia techniques, which I'm not\n\n          going to get into right now. Look, I\n\n          could take you day by day through my\n\n          entire syllabus, but that's not how I do\n\n          things. I'm not one of these stuffy\n\n          teachers who's totally by the book. I\n\n          talk to the kids like they're little\n\n          adults. It's about mutual respect.
