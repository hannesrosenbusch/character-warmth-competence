The sounds of\n\n    WILD BIRDS break the hushed quiet of the setting.

Her precocious young daughter, JILL,\n\n    plays nearby.\n\n\n\n    Jill smiles, watching the baby gorilla clown. As the baby\n\n    sees her, he suddenly scampers to a nearby tree and hides\n\n    his face behind it. Jill does the same. She peeks out to\n\n    catch a glimpse, just as the baby peeks out to catch her\n\n    eye. They both scamper to different trees. Each time\n\n    they move to a different tree, they go through this\n\n    peek-a-boo interaction, both moving further away from\n\n    their mothers. The mother GORILLA notices, lets out a\n\n    CRY. Ruth looks around for Jill and signals by a\n\n    distinctive whistle for her to come back this instant.\n\n\n\n    Both children take a last look at each other and then\n\n    scurry to their waiting mothers.\n\n\n\n                             RUTH\n\n              Jill.
