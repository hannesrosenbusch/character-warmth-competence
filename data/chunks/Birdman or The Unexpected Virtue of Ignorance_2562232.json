RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - DAY                  1\n\n     Close on the brilliant colors of a middle eastern rug, the\n\n     center of what seems to be a makeshift \"meditation\" space.\n\n\n\n     We slowly tilt up to discover the back of Riggan Thomson (55).\n\n     He is in the proper `Lotus' position, dressed only in tight\n\n     white briefs and he appears to be meditating deeply. And if all\n\n     this seems a little odd, it becomes all the more so when you\n\n     notice that he is levitating almost two feet above the floor.\n\n     His breath is calm and measured... in and out... in and out.\n\n\n\n                         MAN (V.O.)\n\n               How did we end up here?\n\n                   (Beat.)\n\n               This place is a fucking dump.\n\n\n\n     We begin to slowly move toward Riggan's back while his measure\n\n     breathing continues. We see a clock on the wall, ticking.\n\n\n\n                         MAN (V.O.)\n\n               Smells like balls.\n\n\n\n     A slight twitch in Riggan's neck.\n\n\n\n                         MAN (V.O.)\n\n               We don't belong in this shithole.\n\n\n\n     A Skype call shatters the silence. Close on his back, we follow\n\n     Riggan as he walks over to the computer and answers the call.\n\n     On the computer screen appears Sam (21), in a pair of Levi's\n\n     and a Led Zeppelin T-shirt. She has simple and striking good\n\n     looks, with an edge in her voice and behind her eyes.

Riggan closes the laptop and leans\n\n    forward trying to regain his calm. His reflection appears in\n\n    the mirror, and for the first time we see his face. He has a\n\n    dark goatee and his hair looks strangely abundant. There is a\n\n    piece of paper on the mirror with the handwritten phrase \"A\n\n    thing is a thing, not what it is said of that thing.\"\n\n\n\n                        ANNIE ON SPEAKERS\n\n              Riggan, they're starting scene\n\n              five.
