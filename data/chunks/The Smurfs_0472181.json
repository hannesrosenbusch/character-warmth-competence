An\nexplosion of blue and white as a throng of blue GNOME-LIKE\ncreatures (SMURFS) explode into view, frantically fleeing with\ngazelle-like precision or like a school of land-going fish.\n(NOTE: Smurfs will be CGI in a live-action world, throughout).\n\nAs they whip past camera, a beast explodes from the bushes,\nleaping directly toward the SCREEN, claws and fangs bared.\nIt’s a huge mangy HOUSE CAT -- terrifying from a Smurf’s POV.\n\nAt the head of the Smurfs is a sweet, dopey, but terrified\nlooking fellow.
