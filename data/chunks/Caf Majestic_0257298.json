Luke is about to swing shut the heavy door, \n               when he looks down and sees\n\n               THE ORANGE TABBY CAT\n\n               shoot into the lobby, stopping in the middle of the floor.\n\n               It looks at Luke, and PURRS.\n\n               Luke closes the door and moves to the cat. He crouches down \n               and pets it, and its back rises to meet his hand.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Hey, fella.

Luke, following the cat, comes around \n               the same corner and looks at\n\n               THE DOOR.\n\n               Slightly ajar, there's a light coming from within, as well \n               as the sound of Old Tim softly humming \"It's a Long Way to \n               Tipperary.\"\n\n               Luke moves to the door and knocks.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Um, Old Tim?

He returns to the spot in front \n               of the TV, and the picture is perfect again.\n\n               The DOORBELL RINGS. He's torn -- if he moves, the picture \n               will break up.

CITY HALL SQUARE - DAY\n\n               Spencer Wyatt's big ban is comprised of a dozen or so \n               MUSICIANS about Spencer's age -- except for the drummer, \n               AVERY WYATT, 40s, Spencer's dad. Though no Gene Krupa, he \n               pounds the skins pretty well, all the while smiling proudly \n               as his son plays clarinet and leads the band.\n\n               Despite the last minute decorations, the Square looks nice, \n               hung with multicolored paper lanterns and colored lights.\n\n               ON LUKE AND ADELE\n\n               dancing to the music, along with several other COUPLES.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                              (nodding toward the \n                              band)\n                         They're not bad.\n\n                                     ADELE\n                         No, they're not.
