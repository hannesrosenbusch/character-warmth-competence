A thickly wooded forest which practically shut out\n\nthe sunlight. All is not serene however. SHOTS RING Out --\n\nand we are privy to a running battle between a German patrol\n\nand a band of Russian soldiers. It is a desperate fight --\n\nand several bodies fall. we see the faces of several men\n\nwhose identity we will learn later. The shooting is still\n\ngoing on when the CREDITS come to an END. Then --\n\n1. THE SLOPE OF A HILL - DAY\n\nThe CAMERA is MOVING SLOWLY up the hill. The verdancy of\n\nthe hill, the intermittent clusters of daisies and dandelions\n\fare evidence of the season -- late Spring. Now the crest of\n\nthe hill is in sight; above it a patch of blue sky is\n\nvisible. The mood is pastoral, peaceful.\n\nThe CAMERA reaches the crest -- and suddenly a pair of highly\n\npolished boots almost fills the SCREEN. The CAMERA comes\n\nto an abrupt HALT. Then SLOWLY, the CAMERA PANS UP from the\n\nboots to take in a carefully tailored German officer's uniform\n\nand then the face of the German officer -- CAPTAIN STRANSKY.\n\nIt is a longish face with a high forehead and light blue\n\neyes. It is a face that gives an impression of extreme\n\nforcefulness, an impression underlined by the thin - lipped\n\nmouth and angular chin. His hair is white at the temples,\n\nemphasizing by contrast the healthy tan of his face.\n\nAt the moment, Captain Stransky is gazing through a stereo-\n\ntelescope. His expression is grim. Behind the Captain\n\nstands LIEUTENANT MEYER, a youngish, good-natured face.\n\fHowever, it is apparent from his expression that he has\n\nno great liking for his Captain. His lips are tight as\n\nthe Captain moves the knobs of the telescope with long thin\n\nfingers. Captain Stransky straightens up, locks back at\n\nLieutenant Meyer, whose expression quickly changes to one\n\nof impassivity.",
