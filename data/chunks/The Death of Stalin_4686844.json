We pan down to see the real STALIN - frail, old,\ngrey hair - at his desk. His frail fingers search through\nlists of names as the Mozart concerto plays on his radio.\n\nHumble decor: a few chairs, a desk, a small bed.\n\nA short, stocky man with cold eyes behind a set of pince-nez\nstands on the other side of the desk.
