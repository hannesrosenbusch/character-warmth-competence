CUTLASS COVE MID-DAY\n\nA flashback to an amalgam of scenes 68 and 75, this\n\ntime shot from a neutral position. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n The action is from where\nLINDA MARSHALL rises and CHRISTINE REDFERN asks the time\n\nto where LINDA MARSHALL enters the sea and CHRISTINE REDFERN\nleaves the cove - only this time we see in CU CHRISTINE\nREDFERN picking up LINDA MARSHALL'S watch which she has taken\n\f137\n\n138\n\n139\n\n127\nContinued ‘\n\noff and left behind her on her first visit to the sea (before\nbeing reminded of the bathing cap), and putting the hands\nback fifteen minutes to 11.45.\n\nPOIROT (V.0.)\n\n. At eleven forty five, and keeping\nher own watch concealed, Madame Christine\nasked Linda the time. Naturally she\nsaid it was twelve o'clock. She then\nstarts to go down to the sea. While her\nback is turned, Madame Christine returns\nthe watch to the correct time. Then\nshe calls Linda back telling her she\nhas forgotten her bathing cap. Why\nshould she bother to do that, you may\nask? The answer is simple, On top of\nthe Fisherman's Chapel in Bibie Bay,\nthere is a bell. Fifteen minutes later\nit was due to strike the hour, and if\nLinda heard it the game would be up.\nTrue, as I knew from Mr Blatt's\nevidence that the wind was South West,\nand therefore blowing away from her,\nbut Madame Christine could take no -\nchances of the sound carrying. A\ngirl splashing about in the sea and\nwearing a bathing cap would hear\nnothing.\n\nEXT. CLIFF TOP ABOVE CUTLASS COVE MID-DAY\n\nCHRISTINE REDFERN looks down and waves to LINDA MARSHALL\n\nin the sea. She waves back.

Suddenly\nto her great chagrin, she sees you,\nMadame, coming down the ladder. Only\nher husband could have presented a\nmore inconvenient figure. Of course\nshe is forced to take refuge in the\ncave ...\n\nCHRISTINE REDFERN takes the green Chinese hat from its hiding\nplace behind the rock, pulls out a false red curl from inside\nit, and lies down on the beach above the water line. She then\narranges the hat over face so that it is hidden, and the\n\ncurl shows to advantage.\n\nPOIROT (V.0.)\n\n.».-Then all you had to do was to take\nthe green Chinese hat, with I suspect\na false red curl pinned underneath\nthe brim at the back, from where your\n\n> partner had hidden it earlier in the\nmorning, and dispose yourself in a\nsprawling attitude with the hat and\ncurl shielding your face and neck.\nAll this has taken you at the very\nmost a further five minutes.

He touches one of the bronzed\narms, then pulls his hand away as if stung. He then lifts\n\nthe hat off the face. In EXTREME CLOSE UP we see CHRISTINE\nREDFERN's face. She winks up at PATRICK. He grins broadly\nbefore replacing the hat, and starting his dialogue with MISS\nBREWSTER.\n\nPOIROT (V.0O.)\nIt is of course Monsieur Redfern who\nruns up the beach, who bends down\nto examine the body. It is he who is\nstunned, shocked, broken by the death\nof his lover. All Mademoiselle\nBrewster had seen was a body with sun\ntanned limbs, wearing a white bathing\ncostume and Arlena's hat. Do you\nremember what I said the first day\nwe met, Mademoiselle? All bodies lying\non the beach are alike. They're not\nmen and women There is nothing\npersonal about them They are like\nrows of butchers’ meat grilling in the\nsun, And it’s true. One moderately\nwell made young woman is very like\nanother. Two brown arms; two brown\nlegs; and a little piece of bathing\nsuit in between.\n\nMISS BREWSTER starts to run off back to-the hotel.\n\nPOLROT (V.0.)\n... No wonder you were fooled into\nimagining that you had seen the corpse\nof Madame Marshall, when what you had\nactually seen was the live body of\nMadame Christine Redfern.
