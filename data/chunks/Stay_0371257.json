She kisses Henry on\nthe forehead. When she looks up we see that her mouth and\nchin are spotted with Henry's blood.\n\nATHENA\n\"Forgive me.\"\n\nSAM\nIt wasn't your fault, Henry. I was\ndriving right behind you. Your\nfront tire blew out.\n\nATHENA\nYou hear that, baby? It wasn't\nanybody's fault.\n\nCLOSE ON HENRY'S EYES. Again, it appears that he understands\nthe message. The words have a calming effect; his face is no\nlonger contorted.\n\nSAM\nWe need an ambulance!\n\nSam stands up and looks out over the backed-up traffic.",

Sam stands up and looks out over the backed-up traffic. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n We\nPULL BACK and see that the bridge is jammed with rush-hour\ncommuters. There is no ambulance coming.\n\nSam crouches down again and peers into Henry's eyes. He takes\nhold of Henry's free hand (Athena holds the other hand)\n\nSAM (CONT'D)\nCome on, kid, you need to stay\nconscious. Come on, come on, wake\nup!\n\nHenry mutters something. Sam leans closer to hear.\n\f103.\n\nHENRY\nYou're real, Dr. Foster.\n\nSam has no idea what Henry's talking about.\n\nSAM\nIt's Dr. Williams, Henry. Just stay\nwith me.\n\nATHENA\n\nHenry, come on. Come on. I need\nyou, baby, come on.\n\nLILA\nI'm losing the pulse, Doctor.\n\nSam begins CPR.\n\nATHENA\nStay, Henry, stay. Stay. Stay.\nStay.\n\nCLOSE ON HENRY'S FACE\nThe camera shows what Henry sees.\n\nHENRY'S POV of the crowd of faces gathered around him. At\nfirst they are clear, each face cleanly delineated. But they\nbegin to blur and merge together.\n\nThe camera PANS UP, past the blur of faces. We see the great\nGothic arches of the bridge from this angle-- the perspective\nof a man lying flat on his back.\n\nWe have seen this view before, in Henry's painting.\n\nThe camera continues to PAN UP, past the glittering towers of\nManhattan, up and up into the nighttime sky.\n\nNow the screen is BLACK, but we continue to hear Athena's\nwords.\n\nATHENA (0.S.) (CONT'D)\nStay. Stay.\n\nThe screen is black for ten seconds. And we think it's going\nto stay black, except now we notices pin-pricks of light\npiercing the darkness.\n\nThe stars are back in the sky, but these are the usual pale\nNew York stars, not the hallucinatory fires that scarred the\nair with their fall.\n\f104.\n\nPAN DOWN to the bridge.\n\nTwo ambulances have arrived, as well as several police cars.\nThe PARAMEDICS (not the same ones we've seen before) load\nthree dead bodies onto stretchers, while the POLICE OFFICERS\nmark the scene and begin questioning people in the crowd.",

Too much.\n\nLILA\nYou did everything you could,\nDoctor. There was never a chance.\n\nSam says nothing.

It glitters in the\nlights of the bridge. But we're pulling back now, farther and\nfarther from the wrecked car, the ambulances, the slow-moving\ntraffic.\n\nWe're rising higher and higher, above the suspension cables,\nabove the great arches, above the blinking red lights that\nwarn airplane pilots.\n\nAll the commotion on the bridge is silent now, nothing but\nbeads of light trickling over the dark river.\n\f"
