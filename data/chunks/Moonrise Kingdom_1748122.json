BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY\n\n                         \n\n          A landing at the top of a crooked, wooden staircase. There is\n\n          a threadbare, braided rug on the floor. There is a long, wide\n\n          corridor decorated with faded paintings of sailboats and\n\n          battleships. The wallpapers are sun-bleached and peeling at\n\n          the corners except for a few newly-hung strips which are\n\n          clean and bright. A small easel sits stored in the corner.\n\n                         \n\n          Outside, a hard rain falls, drumming the roof and rattling\n\n          the gutters.\n\n                         \n\n          A ten-year-old boy in pajamas comes up the steps carefully\n\n          eating a bowl of cereal as he walks. He is Lionel. Lionel\n\n          slides open the door to a low cabinet under the window. He\n\n          takes out a portable record player, puts a disc on the\n\n          turntable, and sets the needle into the spinning groove.\n\n                         \n\n          A child's voice says over the speaker:\n\n                         \n\n           RECORD PLAYER (V.O.)\n\n           In order to show you how a big symphony\n\n           orchestra is put together, Benjamin\n\n           Britten has written a big piece of music,\n\n           which is made up of smaller pieces that\n\n           show you all the separate parts of the\n\n           orchestra.\n\n                         \n\n          As Lionel listens, three other children wander out of their\n\n          bedrooms and down to the landing.\n\n                         \n\n          The first is an eight-year-old boy in a bathrobe. He is\n\n          Murray. The second is a nine-year-old boy in white boxer\n\n          shorts and a white undershirt. He is Rudy. The third is a\n\n          twelve-year-old girl in a cardigan sweater with knee-high\n\n          socks and brightly polished, patent-leather shoes. She is\n\n          Suzy. She carries a one-month-old striped kitten.\n\n                         \n\n          The boys drop down to the floor next to their brother.

A weather vane swings\n\n          creaking on the roof. Tree tops sway in a cluster below. The\n\n          sea is almost invisible in the misting rain, and the mainland\n\n          is a shadow across the sound.

Mr. Bishop is a\n\n          tall, fifty-year-old man in Madras trousers and horn-rimmed\n\n          glasses. He reads the newspaper and drinks coffee. Mrs.\n\n          Bishop is a tan, forty-five-year-old woman in a Lilly\n\n          Pulitzer-type wrap-around skirt. She washes her hair,\n\n          topless, in the kitchen sink.\n\n                         \n\n          In windows, we see Suzy with her binoculars. She watches wet\n\n          branches shaking in the woods. She watches a man in a slicker\n\n          fishing from a row-boat. She watches a white colt in a field.\n\n          She eats a bowl of tomato soup alone in the pantry.\n\n                         \n\n          In the distance, a seaplane flies by below the clouds.\n\n                         \n\n                         CUT TO:\n\n                         \n\n          The edge of a cliff above a white beach.

It\n\n          reads Camp Ivanhoe. A bugler in a khaki uniform with a yellow\n\n          neckerchief plays a staccato tattoo. He has a gauze patch\n\n          over one eye. He is Lazy-Eye.\n\n                         \n\n          A thirty-five-year-old man in the same uniform emerges\n\n          through the flaps of a larger tent. He is Scout Master Ward.\n\n          He puts on a wide-brimmed felt hat. A badge on the crown\n\n          reads Khaki Scouts, Troop 55. He lights a cigarette. A thin\n\n          scout with curly hair and sunglasses joins him at his side.\n\n          He is Gadge.\n\n                         \n\n           SCOUT MASTER WARD\n\n           Morning, Gadge.\n\n                         \n\n                          GADGE\n\n           Morning, sir.\n\n                         \n\n          Gadge flips open a small, spiral-bound note-book.

I'm\n\n           worried, and I'm confused. Please, let us\n\n           find him tomorrow. Please, don't let him\n\n           fall off a cliff or drown in the goddamn\n\n           lake or something. A terrible day at Camp\n\n           Ivanhoe. Let's hope tomorrow's better. In\n\n           fact, I'm going to say a prayer.\n\n                         \n\n          Scout Master Ward presses stop. He kneels down on the floor,\n\n          closes his eyes, presses his palms together, and whispers.\n\n           17.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          EXT. SCOUT CAMP. NIGHT\n\n                         \n\n          Scout Master Ward zips up his tent and turns off the light.\n\n          Crickets chirp. Bats circle.

DAY\n\n                         \n\n          The next morning. A fast current runs along a shallow ravine\n\n          deep in the forest. The boy from the snap-shot rows a mini-\n\n          canoe painted with Native American tribal symbols and\n\n          severely over-loaded with boxes, bags, and blankets. He wears\n\n          a pellet gun slung on a strap over his shoulder and his coon-\n\n          skin cap. He smokes a pipe. A sash across his chest is\n\n          decorated with numerous small, embroidered patches.",

The grass comes up to his chest and flows in waves.\n\n          He pauses to check his compass. He spins slowly one direction\n\n          and then back the other while he stares at the dial.

She stands at the end of a path\n\n          cut through the high grass. She has a leather folder in one\n\n          hand, the portable record player in the other, plus a small\n\n          suitcase and her kitten in a basket at her side. Sam takes\n\n          his coon-skin hat slowly off his head. He strides across the\n\n          meadow. Suzy watches him approach. She swallows. Her lips\n\n          part. Sam comes onto the path.

Two teenagers\n\n          crouched in the wings ripple a narrow, blue sheet across the\n\n          foot of the stage. (This is meant to be water.) The rest of\n\n          the room is dim, with tall candles flickering along the\n\n          center aisle. The beams are draped with garlands. A large\n\n          congregation fills every pew plus folding chairs against the\n\n          walls. More people sit and stand on the steps to the choir\n\n          loft at the back and in nooks and corners. The members of a\n\n          brass ensemble seated beside the organist wait for their next\n\n          cue, following their sheet music with instruments poised.\n\n                         \n\n          Khaki Scouts and scout masters occupy the rear section of the\n\n          church. A very young troop in a slightly different version of\n\n          the uniform fills a row near the exit. Sam sits on the aisle.\n\n          He looks bored.\n\n                         \n\n          A baritone built like a linebacker in robes and a fake beard\n\n          sings ominously on the stage.

A slight, forty-year-old man in the same uniform\n\n          watches him from the end of the pew, frowning.\n\n                         \n\n                         CUT TO:\n\n                         \n\n          Sam quietly entering the lobby.

She snaps her fingers\n\n          suddenly without looking to the children. They fall silent.\n\n          Pause.\n\n                         \n\n          Mrs. Lynn swings open the center doors.

No one pays attention to him. He\n\n          drinks a sip from a water fountain. He picks up a mint from a\n\n          bowl and sucks on it. He slips out through a swinging door.\n\n                         \n\n          INT. DRESSING ROOM. EVENING\n\n                         \n\n          Sam moves down a dark corridor. Voices murmur. He pokes his\n\n          head around a corner. A rack of choir robes and cassocks\n\n          blocks his path. He slides two of them apart and looks\n\n                         THROUGH AT:\n\n                         \n\n          Five eleven-year-old girls in black leotards sitting on a\n\n          bench in front of a mirror framed with light bulbs. They talk\n\n          quietly and fix their make-up. They all wear wings on their\n\n          arms and beaks on their heads. Suzy sits among them in black\n\n          feathers. Sam stares at her. He steps into the light\n\n          silently. Suzy sees him in the reflection.

BISHOP (O.S.)\n\n           Don't make us ask twice!\n\n                         \n\n          Lionel, Murray, and Rudy jump to their feet and race down the\n\n          stairs. Sam dashes to the window. He opens it, climbs out,\n\n          and disappears. Suzy closes her book and rises to her feet.\n\n          Sam's head pokes back up from below. He and Suzy lock eyes.\n\n                         \n\n          Sam smiles. He whispers to Suzy urgently:\n\n                         \n\n                          SAM\n\n           See you tomorrow.\n\n                         \n\n          Suzy smiles back. Sam ducks away. Suzy goes over to the\n\n          window and looks out with her binoculars.\n\n                         \n\n                         CUT TO:\n\n                         \n\n          A binocular shot of Sam dropping to the ground and running\n\n          across the back lawn, into the trees. He comes out on the\n\n          dirt road where Captain Sharp waits, sitting on the hood of\n\n          his station wagon, smoking a cigarette. They both get into\n\n          the car and drive off.\n\n           105.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          Suzy lowers the binoculars. She pauses in front of the easel\n\n          and looks at the picture. She walks quietly away down the\n\n          stairs. The kitten follows her. The record continues to play\n\n          on the empty landing.\n\n                         \n\n          The camera moves in toward Sam's painting on the easel.",
