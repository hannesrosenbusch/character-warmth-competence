An un-\n     lit cigarette hangs in the corner of his mouth.\n\n     In the half-light we can make out that he is on the deck of \n     a large boat. A yacht, perhaps, or a small freighter.

Keaton was under indictment a \n               total of seven times when he was on \n               the force.  In every case, witnesses \n               either reversed their testimony to \n               the grand jury or died before they \n               could testify. When they finally did \n               nail him for fraud, he spent five \n               years in Sing Sing. He killed three \n               prisoners inside - one with a knife \n               in the tailbone while he strangled \n               him to death.
