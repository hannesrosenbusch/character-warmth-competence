At first the scene\nappears bucolic: tall grass, patches of wildflowers, blue\nsky above.\n\nBut as the dog keeps running we see signs of conflict. A\nspear, half imbedded in the earth, rises at an angle. A\nbronze helmet, cracked and bloodied, lies on its side.\n\nThe dog pauses to sniff the helmet then continues his\nsearch. Finally he stops, hackles on his back rising,\nears pricked up. He growls, and we see what the dog sees.\n\nDozens of CROWS have descended into a shallow ravine.\nThey squabble and peck, clustered around something on the\nground.\n\nThe dog growls louder and charges at the crows. The black\nbirds flap away to safety, shrieking in protest.\n\nA DEAD SOLDIER lies facedown in the ravine. Whatever\narmor he wore was stripped away, leaving his body to the\nelements.\n\nThe dog walks slowly to the dead man, sniffing at the\ncorpse's hands. The dog whines and licks the man's\nfingers.\n\nSomething in the air disturbs the dog, who looks up. And\nnow we hear it, faintly, in the distance. HOOF BEATS and\nchariot wheels, marching men, the clank of bronze armor\nand weaponry.\n\nThe dog runs, abandoning his dead master.\n\nTHE MYCENAEAN ARMY 1A\n\nfive thousand strong, storms into the valley from the\nsouth. Armored with bronze breastplates, helmets and\nshields, the soldiers glitter in the morning sun.\n\nRiding alongside the infantry are dozens of horse-drawn\nCHARIOTS, each holding a DRIVER, a SPEARMAN and an\nOFFICER.\n\nOn the opposite side of the valley, three thousand\nTHESSALONIAN SOLDIERS march into view. The Thessalonians\nare less disciplined, their armor and weaponry less\nimpressive.",
