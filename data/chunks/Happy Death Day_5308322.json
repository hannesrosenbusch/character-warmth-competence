The warbled sound grows louder and louder until\nwe...\n\nFADE IN:\nEXT. HOSPITAL BELL TOWER -- POTSDAM UNIVERSITY - MORNING\n\nThe morning sunlight gleams off the great IRON CAST BELL\nas it continues ringing, but at its normal speed.\n\nFrom this high up we can see how isolated the school is --\nsurrounded on one side by thick forest.\n\nA small campus, mostly brick and ivy. In the Quad, a\nfraction of the students amble to their classes.\n\nWe glimpse the highlights: THE FOOTBALL FIELD. SORORITY\nROW. AN ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING. THE DORMS.\n\nINT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING\n\nA boxed shrine to hip. From the “BLADE RUNNER” and\nvintage “STAR WARS” posters to the book shelf lined with\nplastic-sealed comics.\n\nTangled in black skull and crossbone sheets, we find\nTERESA “Tree” GELBMAN, 19, beautiful.\n\nOutside, the bell tolls one final time before a calm\nsettles over the room. The quiet doesn’t last long as\nTree’s CELL PHONE plays “Happy Birthday”.\n\nTree stirs through the fog of her hang-over, searching\nfor her phone. As she sits up, several things hit her at\nonce: she’s not in her room, she's wearing a guy's T-\nshirt, and the guy it probably belongs to is bent down,\nputting something away under the couch.\n\nCARTER DAVIS, 19, good looks hidden behind grunge and\nstubble, turns around and smiles at Tree.\n\nCARTER\nYou’re up. I wasn’t --\nTREE\n(interrupting)\n\nWhere are my clothes?\n\fCARTER\nOn the night stand.\n\nTree fishes her phone out -- 1 missed call from “DAD”.\nShe snaps it shut with an exasperated sigh.\n\nTree pulls off the T-shirt, exposing a black lace bra.\nCarter quickly turns his back to her.\n\nCARTER (CONT’D)\n\nI don’t know if you remember my\nname.

Carter finds a bottle of\n\naspirin in a TOILETRY BAG that was hidden under a pair of\njeans. He offers her a pill.

Got\nit?\n\nCARTER\nSure...\n\nTree starts to leave. The door is covered in a collage of\nband stickers and other bits and strips of randomness. In\nthe middle of it all is a BUMPER STICKER that proclaims:\n“TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF THE REST OF YOUR LIFE”\n\nTree opens the door and collides with a lanky FRESHMAN.\nThe words are already leaving his mouth:\n\fFRESHMAN\nDude! Did you hit that fine-vagine\nor what?!\n\nHe meets Tree’s hard stare and instantly shrinks. Tree\npushes past him.\n\nCarter shoots the freshman a look.\n\nCARTER\nNice one, dickweed.\n\nCarter’s eyes fall on Tree’s GOLD BRACELET, lying on the\nfloor, as it catches the light from the open window. She\nmust have knocked it off the night stand in her haste.\n\nEXT. THE CAMPUS - MORNING\n\nDressed in a slinky outfit and heels, Tree is forced to\nmake the “walk of shame” across the already bustling\ncampus. She shields her eyes from the blinding sunlight.\n\nShe passes a female STUDENT who thrusts a petition at\nher.\n\nSTUDENT PROTESTER\nStop global warming!\n\nTree doesn’t deign to acknowledge the proffered\nclipboard.\n\nA nearby CAR ALARM goes off.\n\nNext, Tree notices a PAIR OF STUDENTS studying on the\nlawn as the sprinklers suddenly go off -- they’re getting\nsoaked as they scramble to protect their books.\n\nOn the left, TREE passes a group of FRAT PLEDGES singing\nloudly.",

LUNCH PATIO - AFTERNOON\n\nA group of Kappa girls have gathered around a table, as\nDanielle conducts a house meeting with the intensity of a\nU.N. assembly.
