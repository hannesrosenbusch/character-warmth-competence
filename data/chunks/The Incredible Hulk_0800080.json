A wasteland.\nHe signals up to CAPTAIN. The boat slows to a halt. The man\nshoulders a small pack. He climbs over onto a ladder and descends\nonto the frozen edge of the pack ice. He turns his back on the\nboat and starts walking toward the distant shore.\n\nThe CAPTAIN stares at the receding figure, expressionless. He\npushes the throttle forward and the boat moves on.\n\nEXT. GLACIER EDGE - DAY\n\nSmall in the frame the man trudges resolute toward nothing. The\nwind starting to whip up.\n\nHe climbs through the maze of ice and rock to reach the plateau of\nthe glacier. He stops and shrugs off the pack, roots around and\ntakes something out, we can't see what. He unzips the parka and\nputs the object in his waist and zips up and sets off again.\nIncomprehensibly he leaves the pack behind.\n\nEXT.

Oblique details like rope tied to jam of kitchen\nwindow and coiled neatly on counter. A Styrofoam head with a wig\nof dark hair and a baseball cap on it. We notice these things\nwithout emphasizing them. A low bed in the corner against a wall.\nNot much else. He's living like a monk.\n\nBANNER is entering, eager to get to work...\n\nHe sits at his roughly fashioned WORKTABLE. On it seems to be his\nonly possessions of note: rows of various SMALL GLASS BOTTLES\nwith liquid in them, neatly self-labeled and arranged in rows.\nOne DECENT LOOKING MICROSCOPE.

Keep me posted. And good luck :)”\n\nAnd Banner begins to work:\n\nMONTAGE: BANNER EXTRACTING A CHEMICAL FROM HIS FLOWERS\n\nOver many hours, Banner works. Methodically and painstakingly\nextracting tiny amounts of juice from his precious flowers, mixing\nit carefully with chemicals from self-labeled bottles and mixing\nit all in an assortment of glasses doubling as homemade test\ntubes; cooking it down over a small gas flame. Referring to BLUE’s\nNOTES on his computer.\n\nFinally, all seems ready...a final step.\n\nHe PRICKS HIS OWN FINGER...so carefully placing ONE DROP of his\nBLOOD on a glass slide. He slides it under the microscope and\nlooks at it:\n\nC.U. - BANNER’S BLOOD: red blood cells fringed with a subtle\nGLOWING GREEN ENERGY. Like residual radiation.\n\nHe takes the slide back out. Takes a breath. This is it.\n\nScript provided for educational purposes.
