LARGE LECTURE HALL - NIGHT\n\n\n\n          The lecture hall has been converted into \"Alpha Epsilon Pi\n\n          Caribbean Night, 2003\" and the party is about as lame as it\n\n          sounds. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n What's important is that this couldn't be less like\n\n          the final club party we saw at the beginning if they were\n\n          playing Pin the Tail on the Donkey.\n\n          Some potted palm trees have brought in along with a steel drum\n\n          set. The man playing the steel drum set has a yarmulke bobby\n\n          pinned to his thinning hair.
