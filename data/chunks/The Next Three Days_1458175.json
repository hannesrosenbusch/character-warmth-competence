The\n\n    driver, JOHN, sees her door open and dives to GRAB her. The\n\n    SUV spins, HORNS BLARE, TIRES SCREECH, cars swerve to avoid\n\n    collision.

JOHN           \n\n    is attractive in a worn kind of way, but has the eyes of a\n\n    kid with a discipline problem. You have to really know him\n\n    to understand if he is mocking you or agreeing with you. He\n\n    is a master of irony and has a true enjoyment of the absurd.\n\n    LARA looks beautiful even in her wrinkled suit. She appears\n\n    to have had a hard day at the office. She's been drinking\n\n    at dinner; it hasn't eased her nerves. John's good-looking\n\n    brother, MICK, boasts his blue collar roots and a gorgeous,          \n\n    if slightly trashy, girlfriend, ERIT, who isn't ashamed of\n\n    her body or sharing her opinions. JOHN and MICK are laughing.        \n\n    Lara puts cash on the tray beside Mick's credit card.                \n\n\n\n                           LARA\n\n               You know what?
