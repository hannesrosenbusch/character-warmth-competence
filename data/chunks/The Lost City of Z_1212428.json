Like a painting by Lorraine, or Corot, or\nTurner.\n\nThe horizon is dark, almost charcoal black.\n\nA thin layer of fog drifts slowly across that abstract\nsurface.\n\nAs the FOG MOVES, it reveals: a MAN.\n\nHe has been running towards us. A silhouette. Like the rest\nof the opening image, his appearance to us should conjure the\nPRIMAL, the MYTHIC, the ELEMENTAL. It is as though he were\nborn out of this fog, this cosmic force.\n\nHe emerges from the fog.\nIt is PERCY HARRISON FAWCETT.\n\nThirties and handsome. Not exactly a youngster, but not\ncreaky and old, either. Strikes us as cheerful. A gentle\nvoice, an even manner. Despite his cheer and charm, however,\nthere is something steely about him, resolved, committed.\nHis eyes reveal a far more complex person than the exterior\nmight first allow; behind their twinkle there lurks a\ncapacity for furious wrath and implacable resolution, the\nmore dangerous because they are held in leash...\n\nOver the wind now, we begin to HEAR CHURCH BELLS RINGING.\nFawcett himself gets closer and closer to us...",

The WOMAN is NINA FAWCETT. The baby is JACK FAWCETT,\ntheir newborn son.\n\nNina Fawcett, thirties, is bubbly and flighty, but also\nhighly cultured.
