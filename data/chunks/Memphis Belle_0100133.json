Six guys on each side,\nall in their late teens and early twenties, wearing\nkhaki pants, work shirts, T-shirts. OVER, we hear the\nvoice of BRUCE DERRINGER. The first player we see is\nVIRGE HOOGESTEGER.\n\nBRUCE (V.0.)\nVirge Hoogesteger., What kind of\nname is that? Nicknamed 'The\nVirgin.’ Well, look at him. Poor\nkid probably tries to get a girl\ninto bed and she wants to make him\nbrush his teeth and wash behind\nhis ears.\n\nThen we see JACK BOCCI bulldozing down one of the\ndefense players.\n\nBRUCE (V.0.)\nLook at this goon. Jack Bocci\nfrom Brooklyn. He's a magician.\nWants to be the next Houdini.\nWell, he's escaped twenty-four\nmissions. Not bad for an amateur.\n\nNext, EUGENE McVEY nervously making a play.\n\nBRUCE (V.0.)\nThis is the religious one.\nThere's always a religious one.\nEugene McVey. Nineteen from\nCleveland. There's always one\nfrom Cleveland. High strung,\nnervous, always coming down with\nsomething. How'd he get in this\nbunch?\n\nNext, we see RICHARD \"RASCAL\" MOORE showing off.\n\nBRUCE (V.0.)\nRascal? That can't be his real\nname. Here we go. Richard Moore,\nbut called the Rascal. Thinks\nhe's a real ladies man. Talks\ndirty, the whole bit. Well, he'll\ngrow out of it. If he grows at all.\n\nThen we see CLAY BUSBY, cooly running with the ball.\n(CONTINUED)\n\f1A\n\nCONTINUED:\n\nBRUCE (V.0.)\nClay Busby, a farmer's son from\nLouisiana.

Even his name,\nDanny Daly. He's the\nintellectual. Writes poetry.\nLikes to read. Hates sports.\n\nDanny makes the touchdown. He shouts with exhilaration\nand raises the ball in triumph. Just then, a huge olive\ndrab B-17 bomber appears out of nowhere and roars\ndirectly overhead. The game is forgotten and everyone\nstarts running towards a short, boxy control tower. Now\nwe see that the football field is a grassy area on the\nside of an air field with three intersecting runways.\nMen are coming from all over the base, on foot and\nbicycle, shouting out the number of planes: five, seven,\nnine, twelve!

The CO is\nshocked by what he hears. He speaks quietly.\n\nco\nWhere? But we hit that target a\nmonth ago, sir.
