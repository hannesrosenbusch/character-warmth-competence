VILLAGE STREET  LONG SHOT  INCLUDING CHURCH\nThe Puritans are marching in solemn procession down the street \ntoward the church.  The crime of laughter on Sunday is so severely \npunished that no one ever dares nod a head in friendly salute as \nneighbors pass neighbors.  Life is vigorous and hard.\n\nDISSOLVE INTO:\n\n2  CLOSE-UP  CHURCH BELLS TOLLING\n\nDISSOLVE INTO:\n\n3  SEMI CLOSE-UP  GROUP OF CHILDREN\nThe children make a comic picture as they march solemnly by with \nmeasured steps, their frightened faces set in rigid masks, their eyes \nround and staring as glass marbles.  They look like little undertakers.\n\nDISSOLVE INTO:\n\n4  CLOSE-UP   CHURCH BELLS TOLLING\n(The repetitious ringing bells in the orchestra pit, deep-throated, \nclanging solemnly, have a funereal sound.  They are arresting and \ndemand attention.  They suggest a Puritan atmosphere, a call to \nchurch, often theirs is a fearful warning tone.)\n\nDISSOLVE INTO:\n\n5  INT. HESTER PRYNNE'S HOME\nIn her quiet room on this gay morning, Hester Prynne, the little \nseamstress, makes ready for church.  She moves with fixed \nsolemnity, her face as serious a mask as the children's who have \njust passed by.  There is something quaint and precise about her \ngestures.  At first sight, she is all Puritan, filled with firm resolves,\npious, reserved.  All this while she buttons herself into her dove-\ngrey dress, then draws her flowing hair back and binds it into a \ntight, firm coil at her neck.  It would be un-Christian if one lock \nescaped.  But when she comes to her bonnet, the eternal feminine \nis revealed.  A bonnet can throw a dreadful shadow over a face, \nor it can be beautifully becoming.  She places it upon her head.  \nShall she wear it perched high, or well down over her eyes?  Or \nperhaps just a wee bit to one side?  She really must see for herself.",

On it is inscribed this warning \nfrom the scriptures:\n\n\t\"Vanity is an evil disease.\"\n\nThen Hester sets it aside and lifts it down.  Behind it is a piece \nof polished metal which serves Hester as a mirror.\n\n6  CLOSE-UP HESTER\nShe practices how she will wear her hat, and her eyes smile \nreflectively, for there is someone at church who may look upon her, \nand she would meet with his approving glance.  Hester forgets it \nis Sabbath and smiles.  It is entirely the fault of that jaunty little \nhat.  Something stirs within her, springtime--a longing for life--\nand love, which is the fulfillment of life.  She starts!  The church \nbells!

The \nvision of how charming the new bonnet is warms her, and her \nmind is filled with material thoughts.  The reflection of the mirror \nstops on the bird cage that hangs by the window.  Hester, \nfrom where she is standing, sees the little imprisoned bird.  She \nputs the worsted mat back in place and starts toward the window.\n\n9  INT. HESTER'S HOUSE SEMI LONG SHOT\nHester moves swiftly toward the open window, through which \nthe light is streaming.  She seems conscious of the transition \nwrought within herself, aware, perhaps for the first time of the \nprison which she has so long endured.\n\n10  SEMI CLOSE-UP AT WINDOW\nClose to the window is a rustic cage with a bird in it.  But a black \nshawl has been thrown over the cage; for the bird's song is forbidden \nto mount on the Sabbath.  A shaft of sunlight has fallen upon the cage.\nHester's face as she gazes at the cage, becomes wistfully sad.",

On the door is the \nsign: \"VILLAGE SEAMSTRESS\").\n\nA stern, forbidding group of men and women is passing.  Among \nthem is Mistress Hibbins, a gossipy, garrulous woman of \nfifty, and Giles, a tall, gaunt Puritan, an unconscious comedian.  \nThe former is Hester's persecutor, the latter her friend.  The \nPuritans pause by the window, listening with horror.  A bird \nsinging on the Sabbath!  Mistress Hibbins, with sly, meaningful \nglances, points at the window.  There they see--\n\n13  HESTER PRYNNE'S WINDOW\nHester is listening to the song of the bird.  She makes a gay little \nfigure framed in the dark window.\n\n14  EXT. HESTER PRYNNE'S HOUSE\nMistress Hibbins, who is the village gossip,--it is she who always \npoints her finger in scorn at Hester--urges one of the Puritans to \nmark Hester Prynne's door.  It is she who says, with malicious \nintent:\n\nTITLE: \"Bird singing on the Sabbath!  Hester Prynne must \n   answer for this!\"\n\nThe man stalks over, and, with a lump of gypsum, marks a cross \nupon the door.  The group nods in righteous approval, all save \nGiles, who pleads that Hester be spared.  And as he does this, \nMistress Hibbins watches him with malicious suspicion.\n\n15  INT. HESTER PRYNNE'S HOUSE SEMI CLOSE-UP WINDOW\nHester opens the door of the cage and peeks in.  \"Good morning, \nlittle prisoner!\" with a merry smile.

She begins:\n\nTITLE:  \"Though it grieves me to tell thee, Reverend Dimmesdale \n   about Hester Prynne--\"\n\nBACK:  As she says this, Mistress Hibbins can hardly hold back \nher smiles.

And if that wasn't enough, Reverend \nDimmesdale, we heard her whistle.\"  The old lady purses up her \nlips and whistles--then gives an imitation of Hester calling, \"Come, \nbirdie, birdie!\" beckoning to the bird.\n\nInto Reverend Dimmesdale's eyes comes a look of stern condemnation.  \n(He has known a rigorous school of religious training, and it \nhas made him stern and severe toward the transgressor.

The springtime \nof the year, the wind blowing her hair, and she is surrounded by \nthe holy beauty of nature.\n\n32  CLOSER SHOT OF HESTER\nThe bird has lit on the branch of a flowering tree.  Hester is creeping \nup to him; she is breathless; her eyes are sparkling.  She no longer \nsuggests the precise little Puritan girl--she is a sprite of the \nwoods!  Her dress is torn, her hair is tumbled.  The bird flies away \nfrom her outstretched hand.\n\n33  LONG SHOT\nHester is running again.

He has heard her speak\nabout her child.  The beadle whispers to the stranger the story of\nHester Prynne, but does not notice that the man's face glows with\nrevengeful light.

The enforced inertia, her inability\nto do anything to help Pearl, is almost killing Hester.\n\n270  EXT.

His sharp eyes shine under lowered brows, and \nthere is an evil look in them as he walks away.\n\n271  INT. HESTER'S ROOM\nThese moments of delay are harrowing ones to Hester.  She knows\nnot which breath may be the last.  She feels that she can endure\ninaction no longer.  She lifts the child, heavy and stiff, in her\narms and staggers with her to the center of the room as if she were\ngoing to run to the church for fear that the minister is not coming \nto her.

For a moment Prynne stands\nwatching these two; and then without a word he leans over and \nexamines the child.  Hester watches him fearfully.  At last he\nslips the knapsack off his back, opens it, and searches for a small\nleather medicine case.\n\nHester pays no heed to him as he prepares some medicine.

Never!\" she cries.  \"Not \neven to my child!\"\n\nHe holds her to him, his temper working up to a violence which\nhe can scarcely control.

Hester goes over to the innkeeper to ask him\nwhich of the men there is the captain of the Spanish boat.

MARKET-PLACE\nThe Election Day procession is coming down the street--the\npeople in the foreground eager to see.\n\n316  SEMI CLOSE-UP  MARKET-PLACE\nHester is standing there, watching the parade.  She is as eager\nand as excited as a child--even more so than Pearl who clutches\nat her mother's hand, rising on tiptoe when the soldiers go past.\nThe people have moved away from Hester, so that she always \nstands alone.\n\nIndians can be seen in the background.\n\nMistress Hibbins comes running past Hester on her way home.\nShe is like a wet hen flying for shelter.\n\n317  FLASH OF THE PROCESSION GOING TOWARD THE CHURCH\nMuch pomp.  The band is followed by the soldiers in glittering\narmor with weapons flashing in the sunlight.  Men from off the\nSpanish ship.  Puritans in their holiday garb.  The minister\nwalks beside the Governor.\n\n318  SEMI CLOSE-UP  HESTER AND GROUP\nHester is no longer able to control her eager excitement.  In a\nfew moments the minister will pass by and their eyes will meet.\nThere will be a salute between them--a flash of recognition.\nIn a few hours they will be away!  She doesn't notice that Roger\nPrynne is walking up to her, standing in back of her.\n\n319  CLOSE-UP  PRYNNE AND HESTER\nHester, conscious that someone is near her, turns slowly and\nlooks into the eye of Prynne.  Prynne smiles and bows, then\nquietly moves away.  Hester's eyes follow him.  The light of her\nhappiness dies out, and then slowly comes back to her as she\ndismisses this fear.  It is only a transient one.  A few hours\nlonger!\n\n320  MEDIUM LONG SHOT\nIn this shot we see the procession passing by Hester.

He, too, knows\na divine happiness.\n\n322  CLOSE-UP  HESTER\nAt the sight of the minister she has forgotten Prynne.  There is\nan air of suppressed excitement about her.  Her eyes answer the\nsignal shot from the minister's eyes.  Their glances say very\nplainly, \"In a few hours, my loved one.\"\n\n323  EXT. CHURCH\nThe minister and the Governor and the beadle enter the church.\nThen all the people pour into the church, for the minister is to\npreach the election sermon.\n\n324  INT. CHURCH\nFor the cutting, it might be well to have a semi close-up of\nPrynne.  His face is gloomy and foreboding in spite of his smile.\nHe slinks into one of the pews and sits down, waiting for his evil\nmoment of triumph.\n\n325  EXT. CHURCH\nThe Puritans have poured into the church.  Hester sees that the\nchurch is filled.  She would go in, but the beadle motions her away.\nShe and Pearl go over to the foot of the scaffold.\n\n326  INT. CHURCH\nThe church is now filled.  The minister is stepping up into the \npulpit.\n\n327  CLOSE-UP  PULPIT\nDimmesdale is standing ready to begin his sermon.  There is\nsomething akin to ecstasy in his expression.  This is to be his \nlast sermon, preached with an exaltation of spirit as if his\ntroubled heart had found repose at last.\n\n328  EXT. PILLORY\nHester stands there alone with Pearl.  The Indians, passing by,\nstop and stare at her curiously.  The child is frightened and\nhides behind her mother's skirts.  When one of the Indians points\nto the letter on Hester's breast, her hands fly to hide it.  She\nlooks at them, hurt and frightened.  Two Indians pass by close\nto the camera, one saying to the other:\n\nTITLE: \"She must be some great dignitary here.\"\n\n(Title to be written in Iroquois language, dissolving into English.)\n\n329  INT.

His hands are uplifted, as if\nin supplication.\n\n331  EXT. CHURCH AT PILLORY\nHester stands there alone, waiting for the minister.  She seems\nlost in a reverie of dreams.  The sunlight is falling upon her\nface which reflects her inner happiness.\n\nFADE OUT\n\nTITLE:  The congregation was spellbound.  Never had their\n   preacher spoken as eloquently as he did to-day.  He spoke as\n   one inspired.\n\n332  FADE IN  INT. CHURCH  LONG SHOT\nThe eyes of the congregation are upon their minister.  As he\nstands in his pulpit he seems almost transfigured, so far has the\nexaltation of prayer carried him.  Then suddenly we see him stop\nshort; his hands fall to his sides.  His eyes are focused on someone \nin the church!  What are his tragic eyes looking at as they strain in \ntheir sockets?\n\n333  CLOSE-UP  ROGER PRYNNE IN THE CONGREGATION\nRoger Prynne is sitting there, his eyes focused upon the minister.\nIn them is a look--terrible, meaningful, triumphant.\n\n334  CLOSE-UP  MINISTER\nThe minister makes an effort to go on, but all strength seems to\nhave ebbed from him, all inspiration is gone.  He cannot move;\nhe cannot speak.  His hand goes to his heart.  He makes a gesture\nof dismissal.\n\n335  LONG SHOT\nThe minister steps from the pulpit and we see quite a movement\namong the people in the church.  Why had that flow of eloquence\nstopped so suddenly?  When they see the minister with his hand\nupon his heart, they know.  He has overtaxed himself; he had\nsummoned too much strength to try to give them a great sermon\nand had over-reached himself.\n\n336  EXT.

MARKET-PLACE\nThe crowd has gathered outside of the church, waiting for their\nminister.  They prepare for the continuation of the procession.\nIt has reached some size.  Again there is evidence of pomp and\nformality.  Soldiers are lining up, forming a pathway which leads\nto the church.  They keep the crowd back, though the latter\npresses forward ready to cry out a welcome to its minister when\nhe shall cross the threshold of the church.\n\n339  CLOSER SHOT\nThe trumpeters pass by Hester and Pearl.  They are followed\nby men blowing fifes and beating drums.  Hester, reaching the\nvery height of her happiness, stands there watching them.\n\n340  INT. CHURCH\nThe church is fast emptying; only a few are left.  The Governor\nand the minister are walking toward the door when Roger\nPrynne steps up to the minister.  The minister can hardly retain \nhis self-possession at the sight of Prynne.  The Governor, seeing\nthat Prynne wishes a few words alone with the minister, passes\non.  The minister is ashen-white; his hand goes to his heart.\n\n341  CLOSE-UP  MINISTER AND PRYNNE\nThe two talk low, tensely.  \"Thou art planning to escape,\" warns\nPrynne.  \"Thou hast dreamed that freedom would come to thee--\nfreedom!\" and he laughs scornfully.\n\nThe minister stares at him, stricken.

AT ENTRANCE OF CHURCH\nThe minister is staggering forward.  He seizes hold of the portals\nof the door to keep from falling.  There is drama in his very \nweakness.\n\n348  SHOT OF CROWD\nHester is in the foreground.  A silence like a pall has fallen\nupon the crowd.  Hester is straining forward, her agonized eyes\nupon the minister.\n\n349  SEMI CLOSE-UP AT DOOR OF CHURCH\nDimmesdale struggles against his growing weakness.
