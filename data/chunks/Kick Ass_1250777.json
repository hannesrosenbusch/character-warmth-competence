NIGHT. 180\n\nThe TWO GOONS guarding either side of the elevator are down.\nBut EIGHT MORE rush down the corridor towards Mindy.\n\nShe doesn’t move, but with jaw-dropping precision, employs\nthe contents of her utility belt. THROWING STARS, KNIVES and\nGRENADES whistle through the air, taking down six hoods in\nquick succession.\n\nA MACHETE spins down the length of the corridor, neatly\ndecapitating a seventh.\n\nThe eighth looks behind him in dismay as he keeps running\n\ntowards Mindy, to discover that he’s now alone. When he turns\nback, Mindy 1s right there in front of him, a small CROSSBOW\nto his forehead. She grins and delicately lets it go. Thwack.\n\f181\n\n99.\n\nINT. D’AMICO’S PENTHOUSE.

Suddenly a shout from behind him:\n\nMARCUS (0.S.)\nHold your fire!\n\nIt’s Marcus.
