It once had dreams of being a mid-level vacation\nhideaway. Those dreams do not appear to have been realized.\n\n“You've got to get me there...”\n\nA wooden arch bears the name of the establishment, welcomes\nvisitors to the mostly-empty parking lot.\n\nA dented gray Studebaker drives through the arch.\n\n(CONTINUED )\n\fBad Times At The El Royale Final Shooting Draft 4.\nCONTINUED:\n\nThe defining characteristic of the parking lot is A RED LINE\nthat bisects the lot dead center and leads straight to the\ndouble doors of the lobby lodge.\n\n“It's twenty-five miles from home...\"\n\nThe Studebaker parks.

As she stares at the El\nRoyale, we can almost hear her thinking, “How in the Lord’s\nname did I end up in this lonely place?”\n\nThis is DARLENE SWEET.\n\nShe opens her trunk and removes HER ODD BAGS. One is a large\nflowered suitcase. The other appears to be an enormous roll\nof fabric, bound with a rope around it.\n\nIt would be too much luggage for a lumberjack, let alone\nDarlene. But she lifts the burden without complaint,\nbalancing one in each arm.\n\nAs she approaches the lodge, she notices A MAN standing in\nthe parking lot:\n\nHe’s in his sixties. He’s wearing a priest collar. He’s\nstaring at the hotel. He looks lost and confused.\n\nThis is FATHER DANIEL FLYNN.\nDarlene slows when she sees him.\n\nDARLENE\nAre... you lost, Father?\n\nFlynn almost jumps when he hears her.

We may notice a bar, a set of tables, a lounge\nseating area.\n\nON THE NEVADA SIDE: everything is decorated in cool purple\nhues. We may notice the front desk, some gaming tables, a\nblack and white television currently showing coverage of\nRichard Nixon’s 1969 inauguration speech.\n\nAt the back of the room, half in California and half in\nNevada, is a colorful JUKEBOX.\n\nFlynn looks down at the border, Darlene follows his gaze.\nThey're both standing in California.
