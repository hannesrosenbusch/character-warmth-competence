Students file out of the building, some alone, some in\nsmall groups.\n\nALYOSHA SLEPTSOV (12) and MISHA KUZNETSOV (12), obviously pals, leave the\nschool, carrying their backpacks. They reach the edge of a large wooded ravine\nthat splits the area into two and take leave of each other with a complicated\nhandshake that includes finger signs and fist bumps, and culminates with the boys\npoking each other in the shoulder. Then, MISHA heads along a path that skirts the\nravine towards some high-rise buildings, while ALYOSHA takes another trail\nstraight down into the ravine.\n\n2. EXT. RAVINE. DAY\n\nThe trail takes ALYOSHA to a paved footpath sparsely edged by street\nlights and benches standing next to trash cans. ALYOSHA walks a little\nway along the footpath, then takes another trail that veers off to the side.\n\nHe makes his way through bushes and tall thickets of deadwood, and finally\nreaches a riverbank. He follows the river for a while, then ducks back into the\nthicket and returns to the paved footpath, which veers sharply up a hill towards\nsome high-rises nearly identical to those on the opposite edge of the ravine.\n\n3. EXT. SLEPTSOVS’ BUILDING. COURTYARD. DAY\n\nALYOSHA walks past a high-rise building with multiple entrances. He turns and\napproaches one of the entrances, presses a plastic key fob against the lock on the\nmetal door, pulls the door open, and disappears into the dusky entrance. The door\ncloses slowly on its automatic hinge, clunking loudly as it catches on the magnetic\nlock.\n\n4. INT. SLEPTSOVS’ PLACE.

As if ina\ntrance, he stares with unseeing eyes at some distant fixed point on the horizon. He\n\fis alone in his room, supposedly doing his homework: his sixth-grade physics\ntextbook is propped up ona desktop book stand before him; a grid notebook is\nopen to a blank page; a pen is clasped loosely in his hand. A little off to the side, on\nthe corner of the desk, sits a bulky laptop with a Batman sticker on its closed lid.\nBesides the desk, the room is furnished with a closet, wall bars for working out,\nanda bed. An Incredibles poster is taped directly to the wallpaper above the bed.\nThe door to the room is slightly ajar.\n\nThe doorbell trills out in the hallway, jolting ALYOSHA out of his reverie.

It’s not him...\n\nANTON\n(whispers)\nThank God for that. That’s good.\n\nThe COORDINATOR returns to the cold storage room.\n\n108. INT. MORGUE. COLD STORAGE. DAY\n\nThe COORDINATOR returns to the cold storage room to see BORIS sitting on the\nfloor, slumped against the wall, head hanging down, face buried in his hands. He\nfeels the presence of another person, lifts his head, glances at the COORDINATOR,\nthen hides his face in his hands again. Blood is smeared under his nose.\n\n109. INT. SLEPTSOVS’ PLACE. ALYOSHA’S ROOM. DAY\n\nBORIS and ZHENYA’s old apartment is undergoing major renovations. A\ncontractor enters Alyosha’s former room from the hallway, crosses over to some\nbags of construction trash stacked by one of the walls, picks one up, and walks out\nof the room. Another contractor is peeling wallpaper from a different wall.\n\n63\n\fEventually, he reaches the Incredibles poster, and pulls it down along with the\nwallpaper stuck to it.\n\nOutside the window, it is winter. Snow is falling over the same view of the woods\nthat stretch as far as the eye can see under a dirty sky, with the same large satellite\ncommunication antenna looming over the forest, its dish angled straight up\n‘observing’ the sky.\n\n110.

LIVING ROOM. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\n DAY\n\nFrom the hallway, we see a 2-year-old child walking brightly around the living\nroom with toy in hand. A TV in the living room is showing a report on the winter\nmilitary action in Debaltsevo, a village in Eastern Ukraine.

Finally, she presses\na button on the side of the phone, switching off the screen, gets up from the couch,\nand carries the gadget out of the room.\n\nOn the other end of the couch, ANTON doesn’t look up from the TV.\n\n113.

BLUE HOUR\n\nTwilight. It’s snowing. A badly faded flier with a barely distinguishable photo and\ntext is taped to a lamp post that stands over a paved footpath down in the ravine.\nThe tape’s dirty edges are peeling off in places. The flier reads “Alyosha Sleptsov,\n12 years old, missing since September 26, 2012...”\n\n64\n\f"
