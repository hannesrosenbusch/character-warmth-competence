I remember\n\n          when I first started to fall in\n\n          love with you like it was last\n\n          night. Lying naked beside you in\n\n          that tiny apartment, it suddenly\n\n          hit me that I was part of this\n\n          whole larger thing, just like our\n\n          parents, and our parents' parents.\n\n          Before that I was just living my\n\n          life like I knew everything, and\n\n          suddenly this bright light hit me\n\n          and woke me up. That light was you.\n\n\n\nTheodore, searching for the right words, quietly enjoys\n\nwriting the letter. As he continues, he is moved by the\n\nmemories he's describing.\n\n\n\n                    THEODORE (CONT'D)\n\n          I can't believe it's already been\n\n          50 years since you married me. And\n\n          still to this day, every day, you\n\n          make me feel like the girl I was\n\n          when you first turned on the lights\n\n          and woke me up and we started this\n\n          adventure together.
