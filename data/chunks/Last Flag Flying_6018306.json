SAL'S BAR & GRILL - NIGHT 1\n\nA seedy neighborhood. LARRY \"DOC\" SHEPHERD, wearing a heavy\nwindbreaker, stands idly on the street. An AWOL bag is on the\nsidewalk at his feet. A garment bag is slung over his\nshoulder. He studies the little working-man's bar across the\nstreet as the title \"DECEMBER 13, 2003\" comes up.\n\nINT. SAL'S BAR & GRILL - NIGHT 2\n\nSmall and dark. A pool table, a few booths, not much decor.\nSAL NEALON leans on his elbows on his side of the bar, doing\na crossword. He's in his late 50s and wears a cropped\nmustache, going gray, like the sides of his short-cropped\nhair. He wears a black T-shirt, revealing a USMC tattoo on\nhis arm. He smokes a cigar, chewing its end more than it\nneeds. An edgy dude - you wouldn't want to fuck with him. At\nthe other end of the bar, COPS is on a TV that hangs\nsuspended from the ceiling. On the show, a nervous couple try\nto explain to a sarcastic cop what they are doing in the\nprojects if not buying drugs. Sal's only customer, O'TOOLE,\nan old functioning alcoholic, is watching. At some point Doc\nenters, pausing near the door. O'Toole gives him a cursory\nglance. Doc hangs his garment bag on a hook on the stanchion\nand takes a stool. He puts his AWOL bag on another stool and\nsettles down with a little uncertainty.\n\nSAL\nI ask you, you ever see these cops\ncatch a killer or a rapist on this\nshow? Ever see them put the cuffs\non some crooked CEO fuck?\n\nWanders over to Doc.\n\nSAL (CONT'D)\nWhat can I get you?\n\nDOC\nBeer.\n\nSAL\nWhat kind?\n\nDOC\n\nDoesn't matter.\n\nSAL\nBottle or draft?\n\nDOC\nDraft.\n\n(CONTINUED)\n\f2.",
