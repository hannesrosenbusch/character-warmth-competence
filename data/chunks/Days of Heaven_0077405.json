They came in the season when work was plenty and wages high. They dressed well, in their own peculiar fashion, and made much of their freedom to come and go.\"\n\n\"They told of the city, and sinister and poisonous jungles all cities seemed in their stories. They were scarred with battles. They came from the far-away and unknown, and passed on to the north, mysterious as the flight of locusts, leaving the people of Sun Prairie quite as ignorant of their real names and characters as upon the first day of their coming.\"\t\t\t\t\t\tHamlin Garland, Boy Life on the Prairie (1899) \nDAYS OF HEAVEN\n\n1\tINT.

You understand? Candy. My kid sister could do this one. Pure fucking candy'd melt in your hand. Don't take brains. Just a set of rocks. I told you this already.\n\nSTEVE\n\nBlackie, you told me it was going to snow in the winter, I'd go out and bet against it. You know?\n\n(to Bill)\n\nThere is nothing, nothing in the world, dumber than a dumb guinea.\n\nBLACKIE\n\nOkay, all right, fine. Why should I be doing favors for a guy that isn't doing me any favors? I must be losing my grip.\n\n(pause)\n\nI got to give it to you, though. Couple of guys look like you just rolled in on a wagonload of chickens. You ever get laid?\n\nSTEVE\n\nSure.\n\nBLACKIE\n\nWithout a lot of talk, I mean? 'Cause I'm beginning to understand these guys, go down the hotel, pick something up for a couple of bucks. It's clean, and you know what you're in for.\n\n3\tEXT. ALLEY\n\nSam the Collector's GANG swaggers around in the alley behind a textile plant. ONE of them has filed his teeth down to points and stuck diamonds in between them. ANOTHER wears big suspenders.\n\nSam and Bill appear to know one another.\n\nSAM\n\nHey, Billy, you made a mistake. You made somebody mad. Nothing personal, okay? It's just gotta be done. You made a mistake. Happens in the best of families.\n\nBILL\n\nI paid you everything I have. Search me. The rest he gets next week.\n\nSAM\n\nListen, what happens if I don't do this? I gotta leave town?\n\nBILL\n\nI could do something, you know. You guys wanta do something to me, I know who to tell about it.

Sam drops a keg of roofing nails on it and, his work done, leaves with his gang. Bill sobs with pain.\n\n5\tEXT. LOT BEYOND MILL\n\nBill and Steve drag a safe by a rope through a vacant lot beyond the mill. Blackie walks behind.\n\nBLACKIE\n\nYou know what I'm doing with my end? Buy a boat. Get that? I had a boat. I had a nice apartment, I had a boat. Margie don't like that. We got to have a house. \"I can't afford no house,\" I said. She says, \"Sell the boat.\" I didn't want to sell my boat. I didn't want to buy the house. I sell the boat, I buy the house. Nine years we had the house, eight of them she's after me, we should get another boat. I give up.\n\nSTEVE\n\nSame as always, I do all the work, you gripe about it.\n\nSuddenly FOUR POLICEMEN surprise them from ambush. Bill lets go of the rope and starts to run. Steve does not give up immediately, however, and they shoot him down. Bill picks up Steve's gun and fires back. Three of the Policemen go chasing after Blackie, whom they soon bring to heel. The FOURTH stays behind taking potshots at Bill while he attends to Steve.\n\n6\tTIGHT ON STEVE\n\nSteve, badly wounded, is about to die.\n\nSTEVE\n\nRun. Get out of here.\n\nBILL\n\n(weeping)\n\nI love you so much. Why didn't  you run. Don't die.\n\nSteve dies. Bullets kick up dust around him. He takes off running. One of the bullets has caught him in the shoulder.\n\n7\tINT. SEWER\n\nABBY, a beautiful woman in her late twenties, attends to Bill's wounds in a big vaulted sewer.

Remember how much fun we had, on the roof...\n\n8\tEXT. ROOF - MATTE SHOT\n\nBill and Abby flirt on the root of a tenement, happily in love. The city stretches out behind them.\n\n9\tINT. BED - QUICK CUT\n\nAbby lies shivering with fever.  Bill spoons hot soup into her mouth. Ursula rolls paper flowers for extra change.\n\nBILL (o.s.)\n\n(continuing)\n\n... even when you were sick and I was in the mill.\n\n10\tINT. MILL - QUICK CUT (VARIOUS ANGLES OF OTHER WORKERS)\n\nBill works in the glow of a blast furnace. He does not seem quite in place with the rest of the workers. A pencil moustache lends a desired gentlemanliness to his appearance. He looks fallen on hard times, without ever having known any better--like Chaplin, an immigrant lost in the heartless city, with dim hopes for a better way of life.\n\nBILL (o.s.)\n\nI won't let you go back in the mill. People die in there. I'm a man, and I can look out for you.\n\n11\tEXT. SIDING OUTSIDE MILL\n\nAlong a railroad spur outside the mill, Abby and Ursula glean bits of coal that have fallen from the tenders.\n\nBILL (o.s.)\n\nWe're going west. Things gotta be better out there.\n\n12\tEXT. TENEMENT\n\nA POLICEMAN, looking for Bill, roughs Abby up behind the tenement where they live. Suddenly Bill runs out from a doorway and slams him over the head with a clay pitcher full of water.\n\nPOLICEMAN\n\nWhat'd you do?\n\nBill shrugs, then hits him again, knocking him unconscious, when he reaches for a gun. Abby calls Ursula and they take off running, Bill stopping only to collect some of their laundry off a clothesline.\n\n13\tEXT. FREIGHT YARDS\n\nThey hop a freight train.\n\n14\tCREDITS (OVER EXISTING PHOTOS)\n\nThe CREDITS run over black and white photos of the Chicago they are leaving behind. Pigs roam the gutters.

Police look for a thief under a bridge. Irish gangs stare at the camera, curious how they will look. The CREDITS end.\n\n15\tEXT. MOVING TRAIN\n\nAbby and Bill sit atop a train racing through the wheat country of the Texas Panhandle.\n\nBILL\n\nI like the sunshine.\n\nABBY\n\nEverybody does.\n\nThey laugh. She is dressed in men's clothes, her hair tucked up under a cap. They are sharing a bottle of wine.\n\nBILL\n\nI never wanted to fall in love with you.\n\nABBY\n\nNobody asked you to.\n\nHe draws her toward him. She pulls away.\n\nBILL\n\nWhat's the matter? A while ago you said I was irresistible. I still am.\n\nABBY\n\nThat was then.\n\nShe pushes her nose up against his chest and sniffs around.\n\nBILL\n\nYou playing mousie again?\n\nABBY\n\nI love how nice and hard your shoulders are. And your hair is light. You're not a soft, greasy guy that puts bay rum on every night.\n\nBILL\n\nI love it when you've been drinking.\n\nABBY\n\nYou're not greasy, Bill. You have any idea what that means?\n\nBILL\n\nKind of.\n\nThey share the boxcar with a crowd of other HARVEST HANDS. Ursula is among them, also dressed like a man. Bill gestures out at the landscape.\n\nBILL\n\nLook at all that space. Oweee! We should've done this a long time ago. It's just us and the road now, Abby.\n\nABBY\n\nWe're all still together, though. That's all I care about.\n\n16\tEXT. JERKWATER\n\nThe train slows down to take on water. The hands jump off. Each carries his \"bindle\"-- a blanket and a few personal effects wrapped in canvas. TOUGHS with ax handles are on hand to greet them.\n\nThe harvesters speak a Babel of tongues, from German to Uzbek to Swedish. Only English is rare. Some retain odd bits of their national costumes, they are pathetic figures, lonely and dignified and so far from home. Others, in split shoes and sockless feet, are tramps. Most are honest workers, though, here to escape the summer heat in the factories of the East. They dress inappropriately for farm work, in the latest fashions.",

Give me a chance and I'm going to dance!\n\nBill struts around with a Napoleonic air, in a white Panama hat and gaiters, taking in the vista. Under his arm he carries a sword cane with a pearl handle. It pleases him, in this small way, to set himself apart from the rest of toiling humanity. He wants it known that he was born to greater things.\n\n17\tNEW ANGLE\n\nBill comes upon a BIG MAN whose face is covered with blood.\n\nBILL\n\nGood, very good. Where you from,  mister?\n\nBIG MAN\n\nCleveland.\n\nBILL\n\nLike to see the other guy.\n\nBill helps him to his feet and dusts him off.

Who're you?\n\nThe Tough hits Bill across the head with his ax handle.\n\nTOUGH\n\nName is Morrison.\n\nBill looks around to see whether Abby has seen this. She hasn't. He walks dizzily off down the tracks.\n\n18\tNEW ANGLE\n\nHe takes Abby by the arm.\n\nABBY\n\nWhat happened to your ear?\n\nBILL\n\nNothing.\n\nShe is a sultry beauty--emancipated, full of bright hopes and a zest for life. Her costume does not fool the men. Wherever she goes they ogle her insolently.\n\nEXT. WAGONS\n\nThe FOREMEN of the surrounding farms wait by their wagons to carry the workers off. A flag pole is planted by each wagon. Those who do not speak English negotiate their wages on a blackboard.\n\nBENSON, a leathery man of fifty, bellows through a megaphone. In the background a NEWCOMER to the harvest talks with a VETERAN.\n\nBENSON\n\nShockers! Four more and I'm leaving.\n\nBILL\n\nHow much you paying?\n\nBENSON\n\nMan can make three dollars a day, he wants to work.\n\nBILL\n\nWho're you kidding?\n\nBill mills around.

Abby nods at Ursula.\n\nABBY\n\nYou're making a mistake, you pass this kid up.\n\nBENSON\n\nGet on.\n\nHe snaps his fingers at her. Bill climbs up ahead of the women. Anger makes him extremely polite.\n\nBILL\n\nYou don't need to say it like that.\n\nBenson ignores this remark but dislikes Bill from the first.\n\n20\tEXT. PLAINS\n\nBenson's wagons roll across the plains toward the Razumihin, a \"bonanza\" or wheat ranch of spectacular dimensions, its name spelled out in whitewashed rocks on the side of a hill.\n\n21\tEXT. BONANZA GATES (NEAR SIGN)\n\nThe wagons pass under a large arch, set in the middle of nowhere, like the gates to a vanished kingdom. Goats peer down from on top.\n\nBill looks at Abby and raises his eyebrows.\n\n22\tEXT. BELVEDERE\n\nAt the center of the bonanza, amid a tawny sea of grain, stands a gay Victorian house, three stories tall. Where most farm houses stand more sensibly on low ground, protected from the elements, \"The Belvedere\" occupies the highest ridge around, commanding the view and esteem of all.\n\nFiligrees of gingerbread adorn the eaves. Cottonwood saplings, six feet high, have recently been planted in the front. Peacocks fuss about the yard. There is a lawn swing and a flagpole, used like a ship's mast for signaling distant parts of the bonanza. A wind generator supplies electric power.",

Bill shouts at the nearest one.\n\nBILL\n\nYo, Beevo!\n\n23\tTIGHT ON CHUCK\n\nCHUCK ARTUNOV, the owner--a man of great reserve and dignity, still a bachelor--stands on the front porch of the Belvedere high above, observing the new arrivals.\n\n24\tEXT. DORMITORY\n\nBenson drops the hands off at the dormitory, a hundred yards below, a plain clapboard building with a ceiling of exposed joists. Ursula sees Chuck watching them.\n\nURSULA\n\nWhose place is that?\n\nBENSON\n\nThe owner's. Don't none of you go up around his place. First one that does is fired. I'm warning you right now.\n\nIn the warm July weather most of the hands forsake the dorm to spread their bedrolls around a strawpile or in the hayloft of the nearby barn.\n\nAbby and Bill slip off to share a cigarette. Ursula tags behind.\n\n25\tEXT. ROCK\n\nBill lifts a big rock. Abby applauds. Ursula kneels down behind\n\nhim. Abby pushes him over backwards.\n\n26\tEXT. BARN\n\nUrsula gasps as Abby tumbles off the roof of the barn and falls through the air screaming:\n\nABBY\n\nUrs!\n\nShe lands in a straw pile.\n\n27\tTIGHT ON ABBY AND BILL\n\nBill takes Abby by the hands, spins her around until she is thoroughly dizzy, then grasps her across the chest.\n\nBILL\n\nReady?\n\nShe giggles her consent. He crushes her in a bear hug until she is just on the verge of passing out, then lets her go. She sinks to the grass, in a daze of sweet intoxication.\n\n28\tEXT. LANTERN - NIGHT\n\nBill looks deeply into Abby's eyes by the light of a lantern that night. They have made a shallow cut on their thumbs and press them together mixing their blood like children.\n\nBILL\n\nYou're all I've got, Abby. No, really, everything I ever had is a complete piece of garbage except you.\n\nABBY\n\nI know.\n\nThey laugh. He bends to kiss her. She pulls away.\n\nBILL\n\nSometimes I think you don't like men.",

Very seldom.\n\nShe kisses him lovingly.\n\n29\tEXT. WHEAT FIELDS - DAWN\n\nThe sun peers over the horizon. The wheat makes a sound like a waterfall. It stretches for as far as the eye can see. A PREACHER has come out, in a cassock and surplice, to offer prayers of thanksgiving.\n\nPREACHER\n\n\"... that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the Lord swore unto your fathers to give them, as the days of' heaven upon the earth.\"\n\nThe harvesters spit and rub their hands as they wait for the dew to burn off. They have slept in their coats. The dawn has a raw edge, even in summer.\n\n30\tTIGHT ON WHEAT\n\nChuck looks to see if the wheat is ready to harvest. He shakes the heads; they make a sound like paper. He snaps off a handful, rolls them between his palms, blows away the chaff and pinches the kernels that remain to make sure they have grown properly hard.\n\nTiny sounds are magnified in the early morning stillness:\n\ngrasshoppers snapping through the air, a cough, a distant hawk.\n\nHe pops the kernels into his mouth, chews them up, and rolls the wad around in his mouth. Satisfied, he spits it out and gives a nod. The Preacher begins a prayer of thanksgiving. Two ACOLYTES flank him, one with a smoking censer, the other with a crucifix.\n\nAll repeat the \"Amen.\" Benson makes a tugging signal with his arm. A Case tractor--forty tons of iron, steam-driven, as big and as powerful as a locomotive--blasts its whistle. This is the moment they have been waiting all year for.\n\n31\tOTHER FIELDS - SERIES OF ANGLES\n\nA SIGNALMAN with two hand flags passes the message on from the crest of a nearby hill. In the far-flung fields of the bonanza other tractors answer as other crews set to work.\n\nAbby and Bill join in, Bill reaping the wheat with a mowing machine called a binder, Abby propping the bound sheaves together to make bunches or \"shocks.\"\n\nA cloud of chaff rises over the field, melting the sun down to a cold red bulb.",

While at work he wears a white smock over all this to keep the chaff off. It gives him the air more of a researcher than a worker.\n\nThe harvesters itch madly as the chaff gets into their clothes. The shocks, full of briars, cut their hands; smut and rust make the cuts sting like fire. Nobody talks. From time to time they raise a chant.\n\nUrsula, plucking chickens by the cookhouse--a shack on wheels-- steals a key chain from an unwatched coat.\n\nBenson follows the reapers around the field in a buggy. He keeps their hours, chides loafers, checks the horses, etc. The harvesters are city people. Few of them are trained to farming. Most--Abby and Bill are no exception--have contempt for it and anybody dull enough to practice it. Tight control is therefore exercised to see that the machines are not damaged. \n\nWhere the others loaf whenever Benson's back is turned, Bill works like a demon, as a point of pride.\n\n32\tCHUCK AND BENSON\n\nLightning shivers through the clouds along the horizon. Chuck looks concerned. Benson consults a windsock.\n\nBENSON\n\nShould miss us.\n\nCHUCK\n\nThey must be having trouble over there, though.\n\nAbby, passing by, lifts her hat to wipe her face. As she does her hair falls out of the crown. Women are rare in the harvest fields. One so beautiful is unprecedented.\n\nCHUCK\n\nI didn't know we had any women on.\n\nBENSON\n\n(surprised)\n\nI thought she was a boy. Should I get rid of her?\n\nCHUCK\n\nNo.\n\n33\tMONTAGE\n\nA COOK stands on the horizon waving a white flag at the end of a fishing pole.

COOKHOUSE - STUBBLE FIELD IN B.G.\n\nThe COOKS, Orientals in homburgs, serve from planks thrown across sawhorses. The hands cuff and push each other around as they wash up. The water, brought up fresh in wagons from the wells, makes them gasp. An ice wagon and a fire truck are parked nearby.\n\nMost sit on the ground to eat, under awnings or beach umbrellas dotted around the field like toadstools. The Belvedere is visible miles away on the horizon.\n\nBill is carrying Abby's lunch to her when a loutish DUTCH MAN makes a crack.\n\nDUTCHMAN\n\nYour sister keep you warm at night?\n\nBill throws a plate of stew at him and they are quickly in a fight. No fists are used, just food. The others pull them apart. Bill storms away, flicking mashed potatoes off his shirt.\n\n35\tEXT. GRAIN WAGON - STUBBLE FIELD IN B.G.\n\nBill and Abby sit by themselves in the shade of a grain wagon. Demoralized, Abby soaks her hands in a pail of bran water. Bill inspects them anxiously. They are swollen and cracked from the morning's work.\n\nABBY\n\nI ran a stubble under my nail.\n\nBILL\n\nDidn't you ever learn how to take care of yourself? I told you to keep the gloves on.

Something about her captivates hint, not so much her beauty--which only makes her seem beyond his reach--as the way she takes it utterly for granted.\n\n38\tMONTAGE (DISSOLVES)\n\nThe work goes on through the afternoon. The pace is stern and incessant, and for a reason: a storm could rise at any moment and sweep the crops flat, or a dry wind shrivel them up. A series of dissolves gives the sense of many days passing.\n\nIany moment and sweep the crops flat, or a dry wind shrivel them up.Animals--snakes and gophers, rabbits and foxes--dart through the field into the deep of the wheat, not realizing their sanctuary is growing ever smaller as the reapers make their rounds. The moment will come when they will every one be killed with rakes and flails.\n\nThe wheat changes colors in the wind, like velvet. As the sun drops toward the horizon a dew sets, making the straw hard to cut. Benson fires his pistol. A vine of smoke sinks lazily through the sky. As the workers move off, the fields grow vast and inhospitable.\n\nOil wells can be seen here and there amid the grain.\n\n39\tEXT. ABBY'S ROW\n\nBill helps Abby finish up a row.",

Abby's hands are stuffed in a chinchilla muff.\n\nAll at once they hear a distant noise like the whoops of an Indian war party. It seems mysteriously to come from every hilltop. Abby turns to Chuck with a puzzled look.\n\nCHUCK\n\nPrairie chickens. That means winter's broken.\n\nABBY\n\nReally? Where are they?\n\nCHUCK\n\nYou hardly ever see them.\n\nThey stand and listen to the birds. There is a sense of the earth stirring back to life.

His heart stirs at the dark, mellow smell.\n\nInto this dissolves an image of Abby writing in her diary.\n\n211\tEXT. FIELD\n\nChuck swings a barometer round and round, checking the weather. Two Case tractors pitch across a field like boats on a rolling sea. Long plumes of smoke wind off behind them. Each tows a fourteen-gang plow.

Everybody does. What do you think all those songs\n\nare about? You need to be careful, though, and not throw it away.\n\nURSULA\n\nThrow what away?\n\nABBY\n\nYou know, your chances.

Dressed in a chauffeur's gown and goggles, he sits against the fender of the Overland watching her move from store to store. Ursula is with her.\n\nThe TOWNSPEOPLE all speak German. Their peasant costumes are freely mixed with Western dress. The signs are old German script.

An INDIAN PORTER\n\ncarts her bags along behind them in a wheelbarrow.\n\nABBY\n\nThey'll teach you poise, too, so you can walk in any room you \n\nplease. Pretty soon you'll know all kind of things.\n\n(pause)\n\nI never read a whole book till I was fifteen. It was by Caesar.\n\nThey laugh at her careful pronunciation of \"Caesar.\"\n\n317\tEXT. TRAIN STATION\n\nAbby's train is about to leave. The CONDUCTOR walks by\n\nblowing a whistle. A five-piece BAND plays Sousa airs.\n\nThey are practically the only civilians on the platform.\n\nThe rest are SOLDIERS bound for Europe, where America has\n\njust entered the War, on fire with excitement and a sense\n\nof high adventure.\n\nURSULA\n\nI like your hat.\n\nABBY\n\nIt doesn't seem like a bird came down and landed on my head?\n\nAbby takes the hat off and gives it to Ursula, who lately\n\nhas begun to take more trouble with her appearance, comb-\n\ning her hair free of its usual snarls. They laugh at their reflection\n\nin a window of the train.\n\nABBY\n\nI hardly ever wear it. Be sure and write every week.\n\nSignals nod. A lamp winks. There are leave-takings up\n\nand down the platform as the train slides away. Abby hops\n\non board. A SOLDIER next to her sheds bitter tears.\n\nURSULA\n\nYou write me, too!\n\nThey wave goodbye.\n\n318\tEXT. ARBORETUM - NIGHT\n\nLate that evening Ursula lowers herself out a third-floor\n\nwindow of the Arboretum with a rope made of bedsheets.\n\n319\tTIGHT ON GIRLS AT WINDOW\n\nThe other GIRLS stand in their nightgowns and wave good-\n\nbye, amazed at her boldness.\n\nShe slips off into the night.\n\n320\tEXT. BACKSTAGE DOOR - NIGHT\n\nUrsula looks in a backstage door. She can see, through\n\nthe wings, a MAN dancing on stage. There is a feeling of\n\nmad excitement about the place.\n\nThe person she is looking for is not here, however.\n\n321\tEXT. ALLEY - URSULA'S THEME - NIGHT\n\nShe runs down an alley. A man steps out of the shadows--\n\nGeorge, the pilot.",

A man steps out of the shadows--\n\nGeorge, the pilot. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\n She throws herself in his arms. This\n\nis our first sight of him since he left the bonanza.\n\nURSULA\n\nYou're here! Oh, hug me!\n\nThey kiss madly, with mystery. The moonlit, midsummer night thrums\n\nURSULA\n\nAren't we happy? Oh, George, has anybody ever been this happy?\n\nHe rocks her back and forth in his arms. They laugh,\n\nthinking what lucky exceptions they are to the world's\n\nmisery.\n\nURSULA\n\nHurry.  They'll be looking for me.\n\n322\tEXT. AIRPLANE - DAWN\n\nGeorge bundles Ursula, giggling, into a biplane.\n\nURSULA\n\nThis doesn't even belong to you. Suppose they catch us?\n\n323\tEXT. PASTURE -- DAWN\n\nFrom a pasture outside town the plane rises into the vast dawn sky.\n\n324\tINT. TEXTILE FACTORY\n\nAbby changes bobbins on a huge loom. A pall of lint and\n\nanonymous toil hangs over the factory. Down the way a\n\nhandsome MALE WORKER smiles at her. She smiles back,\n\ninterested.\n\nABBY\n\nIt seems an age we've been apart, and truly is for those who\n\nlove each other so. Whenever shall we meet?'\n\n325\tTIGHT ON MACHINERY\n\nThe shuttle rockets back and forth. Off camera we hear\n\nAbby reading what seems part of a letter to Ursula.\n\nABBY (o.s.)\n\nSoon, I hope, for by and by we'll all be gone, Urs. Does\n\nit really seem as though we might?'\n\n326\tUNDERWATER SHOT\n\nWe look from the bottom of a river up toward the light. \n\nIn the foreground, dangling from the tip of a submerged\n\nlimb, is the bracelet Abby threw away.\n\nABBY (o.s.)\n\n'The other day I tried to think how I'd look laid out in a solemn\n\nwhite gown. Closing my eyes I could almost hear you tiptoe inlook down in my face, so deep asleep, so still.\n\n327\tEXT. FIELDS - SERIES OF ANGLES\n\nThe PEOPLE of the Razumihin rebuild the land -- raising\n\nfences and sinking a well, plowing down the stubble and\n\nputting in the seed.\n\nABBY (o.s.)\n\n'I went to Lincoln Park Zoo the other day. It was great as usual.",
