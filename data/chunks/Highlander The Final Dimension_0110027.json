Something catches his attention.\n\n\nMACLEOD'S POV\n\nJennifer is gagged and tied to a chair which has been placed on\ntop of a long table.  Another chair has been placed about three\nfeet away from her on the table.  On the second chair a\nCROSSBOW has been mounted and aimed at Jennifer.  A ROPE is\ntied to the TRIGGER and stretched to her chair.  A WEIGHT has\nbeen tied in the center of the rope.  A CANDLE burns behind the\nWEIGHT.  When it burns though the rope the WEIGHT will fall and\nthe CROSSBOW will fire at Jennifer.\n\nKilvara steps out of the shadows, a wicked grin on his face.\n\n\n                                                            87\n\n                    KILVARA\n          Clever -- don't you think.  You can\n          save her.  All you have to do is blow\n          out the candle.  Of course, you have\n          to get past me to do it.\n\nThe rope is beginning to turn black as the candle burns deeper\ninto it.  Macleod knows he has little time before the ropes\nsnaps.  He moves towards her.",

Macleod looks at\nKilvara, then across the room.  He has only a second to decide:\nKilvara or Jennifer.\n\nMACLEOD'S POV\n\nThe ROPE is about to snap -- strands are staring to fray.\n\nMacleod runs across the tabletop and jumps onto another as he\nheads for the long table across the room.\n\nKilvara stands -- picks up his sword and runs after Macleod.\n\n\n                                                            88\n\nMore strands of the rope snap as the flame burns deeper in the\nrope.

Kilvara looks at Bedsoe, then at Macleod.  He is only\na few feet away.  He thinks -- then lunges at Macleod.\n\nBedsoe fires two shots.  They hit Kilvara in the chest.  He\ndrops to the ground.\n\nMacleod unties Jennifer quickly.  Bedsoe moves across the room\ntowards them.
