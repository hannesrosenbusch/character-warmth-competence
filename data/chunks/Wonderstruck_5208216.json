He manages to glance back behind him.\n\nIn a shaky dark swirl we catch glimpses of what appear to be\nanimals, black against the blue snow, chasing after him. In a\nglimpse of light their eyes flash, revealing TWO WOLVES -\ntearing through the moonlit woods.\n\nThe boy tries desperately to pick up speed, dodging fallen\nlimbs and rocks along his way. Strangely, he’s barefoot, in a\nthin tank-top and pajama bottoms, running through a dark,\neerie landscape.\n\nUp ahead he sees a way to veer off from the path and dip down\nalong an incline. He takes the turn, tearing through brush as\nhe descends along the side of a hill into a slight recess,\nhoping to drop out of sight.\n\nThrough the black mesh of trees he spots the wolves running\npast. In relief, he exhales loudly, catching his breath. Then\nhe pulls himself up. He turns - and gasps.\n\nThe two wolves have reverted course and are racing right\ntowards him. Startled, he loses his footing, and stumbles to\nthe ground. His foot is tangled in some roots. He starts\nyanking with all his might, glancing up to see:\n\nThe wolves are galloping toward him.
