ORPHANAGE DORMITORY - NIGHT                 35\n\n\n\n     Young Raizo, still blindfolded is in bed. Trying to\n\n     sleep, but it's impossible. Takeshi's snoring doesn't\n\n     help.\n\n\n\n     He turns slightly towards Kiriko, as her chest rises and\n\n     falls, her breath as rhythmic as and gentle as the lap of\n\n     sea-water in a tidal pool. He begins to breathe in sync\n\n     with her, perhaps in hopes it will relax him.\n\n\n\n     Slowly, all the other sounds in the room go away, until\n\n     only her breathing, and his, remains. There is the\n\n     slight murmur of their hearts.\n\n\n\n     Then she opens her eyes...and smiles at him because he\n\n     cannot see her. But he hears her heart begin to beat\n\n     faster and that brings a faint smile to his lips.\n\n\n\n     They listen to each other's breathing growing heavier,\n\n     the sound of their hearts beating faster and faster.\n\n\n\n     Her lips part as she makes the tiniest movement...tilting\n\n     her pelvis up, rubbing her hips ever so slightly against\n\n     the blanket-\n\n\n\n     It's like tectonic plates shifting for Raizo.\n\n\n\n     Bump-thump, bump-thump, bump-thump their hearts growing\n\n     louder and louder as they become-\n\n\n\n\n\n36   EXT.
