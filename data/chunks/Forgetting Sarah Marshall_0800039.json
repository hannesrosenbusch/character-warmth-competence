  "1": "FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL\nby\n\nJason Segel\n\nDecember 18, 2006\n\nWGAw\n\fINT. PETER’S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON\n\nPETER BRETTER (26) watches television alone in his dark,\ncreepy apartment. A fake MUMMY lies in the corner. Vintage\nmagician posters and a giant, creepy French Clockwork Orange\nposter adorn the walls. Cigarette butts, overflowing\nashtrays and bottles of liquor crowd the table and a GIANT\nPLASMA TELEVISION adorns one wall. In the corner are a\nguitar and keyboard.\n\nPeter sits, smoking, watching THE ISLAND with SCARLETT\nJOHANNSEN. THE COLONY IS ADDRESSED BY A MAN ON PLASMA\nSCREENS THROUGHOUT THE COMPOUND\n\n---Peter has made it so his computer is being mirrored on his\nGIANT PLASMA. He sits in front of his computer’s camera so\nthat his GIANT FACE is on the tv. He is wearing a Jacket and\nTIE.\n\nPETER\n(mimicking THE ISLAND)\nThe lottery will begin in twenty\nminutes. The lucky winners will get\nto smoke a gigantic joint.\n\nPeter chuckles to himself and lights a joint, which he\nwatches himself smoke on TV. He tries to make smoke rings.\n\nWe pull back to reveal, that he is wearing only the top half\nof a suit and boxers.\n\n-- Peter’s watching the Red Shoe Diaries. The part that\nDuchovny narrates.\n\n-- Peter opens his fridge. It has nothing in it except for\nsome old orange juice.\n\n-- Peter’s on his couch drinking old orange juice from the\ncarton, smoking, watching an informational about a treadmill.\n\n-- Peter’s on the phone.\nPETER (CONT'D)\nYeah. I don’t need the elliptical.\nJust the treadmill. Thanks. It’s\na Mastercard.\n\n-- Peter’s pulled the treadmill out of its box.\n\n-- It’s some time later. The treadmill is covered in\nashtrays and various junk. Peter’s on the phone.\n\fPETER (CONT'D)\nWell, that’s great. Topher sounds\nreally cool. I’m glad you’re\nhaving fun. I’m OK. No, I’m fine.\nSeriously, I’m doing fine.",

Have fun\nat the wrap party.\n\nPeter hangs up. He then hits the treadmill on and watches\nwith little interest as a bunch of full ash trays, half-\nfilled soda bottles, and papers go flying off it.\n\n-- Peter sits on his couch drinking coffee watching Talk\nSoup. It goes to a commercial for “Comedy Mondays” and we\nsee a brief promo for “GRACE IS ACES,” starring “Emmy Nominee\nSARAH MARSHALL.” Peter beams.\n\nPETER (CONT'D)\nThat’s my girl.\n\nHe addresses a Muppet style DRACULA PUPPET in the corner.\n\nPETER (CONT'D)\nWe’re gonna get to snuggle in only\ntwenty three days, huh Vlad?\n\n-- Peter watches the Red Shoe Diaries again. As he does so,\nhe bounces a ball against Duchovny’s face.\n\n-- Peter's asleep. It’s 3:45PM. The phone rings. He lets\nit go to answering machine.\n\nBRIAN (0.S.)\n(answering machine)\nYo, it’s your bro. Pick up pick up\npick up pick up pick up.\n(sighs)\nSince your lady’s not in for a\ncouple more days, I was thinking\nyou could let me and Liz take you\nout for a meal. I know you’re\nthere. Pick up pick up pick up\npick up\n\nPeter ignores the machine.\n\n-- Peter's alarm goes off. The Cardigan’s “Lovefool” begins\nplaying. Peter HOPS OUT of bed.\n\n-- Peter, in a nice suit and nice shirt, sits expectantly on\nhis couch. The phone rings. Peter answers it.\n\fPETER\nHey, sweetie!\n(then)\nNot for another week? Oh. No,\nthat’s totally great. Say hello to\neveryone for me. Love ya.\n\nPeter leaves the room and returns seconds later wearing his\nold sweatpants and dirty T-shirt.\n\nINT. SHOWER - LATER\n\nPeter stands, scrubbing and singing in a STRANGE OPERATIC\nVOICE. The phone rings. He grabs a cordless next to the sink.\n\nPETER\nHello? Hey Baby! Welcome Home!! I’m\njust in the shower singing. I think\nI’m zeroing in on Dracula’s point\nof view.",

Oh, okay, see you ina\nminute.\n\nPeter hangs up and looks at the phone, a bit concerned.\n\nINT. PETER’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER\n\nA knocking at the door. Peter comes out from the bathroom,\ndripping wet, naked, drying himself with a towel. He opens\nthe door for his stunningly beautiful girlfriend, SARAH\nMARSHALL (30). She enters as Peter continues drying himself\nwith the towel, casually exposing his naked body.\n\nPETER\n(big, goofy smile)\nHey lover! Just scrubbing up for\nyou.\n\nShe can barely look in Peter’s direction.\nSARAH\nPete, as you know, I love you very\nmuch. But...\n\nPeter drops his towel.\n\nPETER\nAre you breaking up with me?\n\f4.\n\nShe looks down at the floor. Then she nods. Peter looks in\ncomplete shock. He sits down on the couch and tries not to\nhyperventilate.\n\nSARAH\nWhy don’t you put on some clothes\nand let’s discuss this?\n\nPETER\n(already teary)\nI can’t do anything right now.\n\nSARAH\n(sweetly)\nHoney, I’m sorry...\n\nPETER\n(starting to lose it)\nWhat is going on? I love you, I\nlove you, please don’t do this --\n\nSARAH\n\nJust put on some clothes --\nPETER\n\nWill that make you not break up\n\nwith me?\nSarah touches Peter’s shoulder. He roughly shakes her off.\n\nPETER (CONT'D)\nI’m sorry, I’m just... oh god.\n\nPeter sobs so hard that he begins to choke on his breath.\n\nPETER (CONT'D)\nI’m in control, I’m in control, I’m\nfine, let’s talk. Why?\n\nShe starts to speak.\n\nPETER (CONT'D)\nJust tell me why.\n\nSARAH\n(super rehearsed)\nPete, as you know, I love you very\nmuch.\n\nPETER\nYou already said that.

I’11 jump in the lake.\n\nSARAH\nI know you would, but it wouldn't\nbe for the right reasons.\n\nPETER\nWhy now?

PETER’S APARTMENT - LATER\n\nPeter sits on the couch with his younger brother BRIAN\nBRETTER (23). Three boxes of Camels sit in front of Peter,\nwho smokes one as he drinks a fuzzy navel, clearly not his\nfirst.\n\nBRIAN\nAre you sure you don’t want to eat\nsomething with that?\n\nPeter shrugs indifferently. Brian OPENS Peter’s fridge.\nThere’s an old piece of moldy American cheese. That’s it.\n\nBRIAN (CONT'D)\nYour place has gotten really\ndisgusting. I had no idea American\ncheese could sustain mold.\n\nPETER\nCan we please focus on the fact\nthat the love my life has just\ndumped me? It’s going to be OK,\nright?\n\nBRIAN\nIt will be.
