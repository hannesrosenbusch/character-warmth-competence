When she\ncatches sight of herself in the mirror, she is startled\nand a little embarrassed. She sees Macon's reflection\nin the mirror watching her and, almost reflexively,\npushes the bathroom door halfway closed to obliterate\nhis view.\n\nMacon slowly lowers himself down into the bed, and\n\nsuddenly the CAMERA is CLOSE ON him in_exactly the same\ni i i at\n\nthe start of their affair. And like then, Macon lies in\nbed and HEARS: Sarah running water in the bathroom,\nmoving about the room as she gets undressed and hangs\nher clothes, the TINKLING of the chain as she slips it\non the door, the SWITCHING OFF of the lights. The bed\nmoves and Macon's back stabs pain as Sarah slips in\nbeside him, but he makes no sound. He listens te Sarah's\nbreathing as it softens almost immediately.\n\nINT.

He sets the bag on\nthe curb, takes out Ethan's picture, leaves the bag, and\nhurries on. Up ahead he sees a taxi with a boy just step-\nping out of it. Raising either arm is impossible. He is\nforced to run in an absurd, scuttling fashion while\nshouting bits of French.\n\nMACON\nAttendez! Attendez, monsieur!\n\nThe taxi is already moving off and the Boy is just slip-\nping his wallet back into his jeans when he sees Macon\nand calls out something and the taxi brakes.
