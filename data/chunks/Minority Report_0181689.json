Her eyes are closed in\n\n               sleep, or in death ... or in something in between.\n\n\n\n               Now TWO MORE FACES emerge out of the darkness.  They are\n\n               male, and they float into position on either side of the\n\n               female.  They are just as ethereally beautiful, just as pale,\n\n               and like the female their eyes are closed.\n\n\n\n               The ghostly lips of the female begin to twitch.  Her features,\n\n               which have been expressionless, suddenly contort, mask-like,\n\n               into the face of a woman in fear.  Her eyes open.\n\n\n\n               The male face on her right contorts too.  His features warp\n\n               into an angry snarl -- the mask of a man enraged.  His eyes\n\n               open.\n\n\n\n               The male face on her left takes on the expression of a young\n\n               boy, a boy who is terribly frightened.  His eyes open wide.\n\n\n\n               As if they are lost in the same terrible waking dream, a\n\n               sudden and unnerving exchange begins ...\n\n\n\n                                     FEMALE\n\n                              (frightened woman)\n\n                         JOHNNY, PLEASE\n\n                                     \n\n\t\t                     MALE RIGHT\n\n                              (mocking man)\n\n                         \"Johnny, please.

They do not move.\n\n\n\n               So that when they do move again, it is startling.  In abrupt\n\n               unison, the EYES flash open.  Three pairs of eyes stare\n\n               straight at us, accusing.\n\n\n\n               Three mouths open, but speak, in rasping tones, as one.\n\n\n\n                                     ALL THREE\n\n                         Murderer!\n\n\n\n               The faces linger a moment, the weary eyes slowly close, and\n\n               the dark reaches forth, and takes them.\n\n\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\n\n               EXT.

Mothers in bright dresses stand in doorways,\n\n               watching.  The smiling mothers wave to one another, then go\n\n               back into their houses.\n\n\n\n               Dogs bark, birds sing in trees of just the right height,\n\n               boys and girls laugh and ring the bells on their trikes.

It is impossible to tell which officers are real, and\n\n               which are scanned holographs.

She is dried, dressed\n\n               in a robe, then guided into an over-sized, throne like chair.\n\n               Her brothers are guided into their thrones, on either side\n\n               of her.\n\n\n\n               Not once are their helmets removed.

And then Witwer begins\n\n               to laugh.\n\n\n\n               INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER\n\n\n\n               The room is utterly dark and silent.  The silence is broken\n\n               by the SOUND of something rolling across the floor.  Somebody\n\n               speaks, probably the guard.\n\n\n\n                                     VOICE\n\n                         Shit.\n\n\n\n               An explosion of light fills the room in STROBE-LIKE blasts.\n\n               And leaping through the light is ANDERSON.  The temporarily\n\n               blinded guard and technicians have dropped to their knees.\n\n               Anderson stun guns them quickly.\n\n\n\n               The strobes fade, and Anderson sets a zirc-flare on the floor.\n\n               We see that the enzyme is wearing off -- his facial features\n\n               are returning to normal.\n\n\n\n               He is oblivious to the Precogs in their chairs.  It is the\n\n               equipment he is after.\n\n\n\n               Through the observation window we see ENNIS PAGE watching in\n\n               horror as Anderson severs the light cables connecting the\n\n               Precog helmets to the mainframe.\n\n\n\n               Anderson aims a sonic blast at the observation window, blowing\n\n               it out and knocking Page unconscious.  Then he reaches into\n\n               the room and destroys the mainframe itself with a series of\n\n               blasts.\n\n\n\n               Anderson is so intent on destruction he does not sense a\n\n               PRESENCE behind him.  Perhaps it is because the movement is\n\n               so completely devoid of malice it is beyond detection.\n\n\n\n               A HAND, the fingers pale and slender, reaches out and takes\n\n               hold of his hand.\n\n\n\n               Anderson whirls around, weapon out.  And there before him,\n\n               is the FEMALE Precog.  He looks at her, then beyond her to\n\n               the other Precogs who are lolling in semiconsciousness in\n\n               their chairs.\n\n\n\n               Her helmet is off.  She is young, but her close-cropped hair\n\n               is silver white.
