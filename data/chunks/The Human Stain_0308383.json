Nowadays it's\nimpossible to imagine anyone doing\nwhat my brother felt he had to do\nthen... constructing his whole\nlife around a lie. He could have\nstopped that racism charge in its\ntracks - I wonder if that solution\neven occurred to him. Tell me\nsomething, Mr. Zuckerman. Did he\never acknowledge what he'd done?\nTo anyone?\n\nCLOSE ON NATHAN--He is silent for a long beat.\n\nNATHAN\nNo, I don't think so. I don't\nthink he did.\n\nERNESTINE\n\n(a rueful smile)\nSo he was Coleman until the end.\nSet out to do something and do it\nall the way.
