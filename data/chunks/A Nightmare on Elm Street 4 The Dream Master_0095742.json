She doesn't move.  \n\n       Freddy advances on her.  Going in for the kill.  Just when \n\n       he's close enough, Alice springs up.  She was playing possum.\n\n\n\n       She reaches out and PUNCHES a hole in the wall behind the \n\n       debris of the confessional.  She pulls out several crackling \n\n       electric cables.  She looks bizarre and powerful framed for a \n\n       moment in the blue light of the sparkling electricity.",

Freddy LAUGHS at her and it.\n\n\n\n       Alice shoves on of the electric cables into the center of the \n\n       gadget.  It HUMS and BUILDS and GLOWS until a LOUD, \n\n       incredibly powerful LASER BOLT shoots out of it and hits \n\n       Freddy square in the chest.\n\n\n\n       A stunned Freddy looks at his mid-section.  Quite frankly, \n\n       it's missing.  There's only a gaping, smoking hole through \n\n       which Alice can see the rest of the church.\n\n\n\n       Alice throws the smoking gadget and cable to the floor.  She \n\n       has no time to savor her temporary victory however.\n\n\n\n       Freddy's playing fill in the blanks with himself.  The \n\n       charred hole in his mid-section begins to fill in.  In a \n\n       matter of seconds, he's whole again.\n\n\n\n       He laughs and starts to advance on Alice.  Frustrated, she \n\n       grabs a huge cross which she handles easily, then charges \n\n       him.\n\n\n\n       Freddy raises the cross.  On one pass, she tears open \n\n       Freddy's sweater, revealing the faces of the souls trapped \n\n       within Freddy.  She gags at the sight.\n\n\n\n       Freddy seizes the moment and grabs the cross.  He tosses it \n\n       away.\n\n\n\n       Freddy SMACKS Alice across the face.  He grabs the back of \n\n       her head and throws her over him, across the church and into \n\n       the altar.  He advances on her.\n\n\n\n                           FREDDY (cont'd)\n\n                 I am eternal...\n\n\n\n       Alice is looking pretty bloody.  She tries to fend off Freddy \n\n       but he smashes her into the opposite wall.  She crumples in \n\n       pain beneath the broken stained glass window she came in \n\n       through.\n\n\n\n       Freddy's coming for her.  His tongue wiggling like a demented \n\n       Wile E.

A tiny hand smashes through one eye.\n\n\n\n       Finally, Freddy's head EXPLODES and the freed souls pour out.  \n\n       The force SHATTERS the glass in Alice's hands.
