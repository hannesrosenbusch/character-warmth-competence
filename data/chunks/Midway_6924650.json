My final order is\nthat you carry on your loyal service\nto the Emperor.\n\nTamon snaps his heels together and then turns to face west.\n\nTAMON (CONT'D)\nBanzai!\n\nThe men shout three banzais in response, the words ringing\naround the deck of the doomed carrier.

I'll need it for a square\nmeal in hell.\n\nTamon smiles slightly at his own joke, but the other officers\nare hollow-eyed.
