ALASKAN COAST - DUSK - PRE-TITLES 1\n\nTITLE: TWO DAYS AGO. Snowstorm. A single man in a rowboat --\nthe STRANGER -- forges through the icy waters toward the\n\ncoast. It’s hard to say how old he is -- 20s, 40s? -- because\nhe’s so filthy and red-eyed and yet so fiercely driven.\n\nIn shadows behind him stands the eerie, forbidding SHIP which\nbrought him this far. Hitting the edge of the ice, the\nStranger clambers out of his boat and trudges inland, smiling\nthinly as he sees the boat drift away, no use to him anymore --\n\nTITLES ROLL as we follow the Stranger through the wide, eerie\ntwilight of the Alaskan wilderness -- blasted by the wind yet\npersevering, too yearning and wild-eyed to slow down --\n\nAs he crests a small ridge of ice, we see a clutch of lights\nshimmering in the distance: BARROW, ALASKA. An Arctic outpost\nof a town, an oil and mining outpost ringed with derricks and\ntundra. The Stranger grins as he sees Barrow twinkling\nthrough the snowstorm, and presses onward AS TITLES END --\n\nEXT. SLOPE - SUNDOWN 2\n\nTITLE: TONIGHT.
