The object is an iron lung, and its purpose is to keep\n\n     its occupant, Mark O'Brien, breathing. Every 4.5 seconds, the\n\n     pump mechanism creates a vacuum inside, forcing Mark's chest\n\n     to expand and suck in air.

Through the portholes, we just make out the shape of\n\n    Mark's bent, undersize body.  Suddenly, Mark's nose twitches.\n\n    He opens his eyes and grimaces.\n\n\n\n                           MARK\n\n              Shit!\n\n\n\n    His face continues to contort as he tries to cope with the\n\n    terrible itching.

The first hints\n\n    of dawn start to appear through the curtains. They\n\n    illuminate a large framed portrait of the Virgin Mary hanging\n\n    on the wall.

At least I was\n\n                    able to see the cup-of-life\n\n                    metaphor as a useful tool. Of\n\n                    course, the two halves were never\n\n                    even. Not in my case, that's for\n\n                    sure. Look at all the years of\n\n                    unendurable crap I've had to put up\n\n                    with. That fills most of the cup.\n\n                    But in the little bit that's left,\n\n                    what do I have to show for myself?\n\n                    Journalism? Poetry? At the very\n\n                    least, three beautiful women who\n\n                    all loved me and will all show up\n\n                    at my funeral.\n\n\n\n       EXT.

He retrieves the mail,\n\n       sifts through it and pauses over a letter. He is tempted to\n\n       open it, but thinks better of it.\n\n\n\n       EXT.   CHERYL'S BACKYARD.

Sometimes he shows up\n\n                 as a coyote, sometimes as a raven,\n\n                 but he always does the unexpected.\n\n                 The trickster breaks the rules.\n\n                 Mark O'Brien, whose life we're\n\n                 celebrating today, was very much\n\n                 the trickster -- anyone who knew\n\n                 him knew that.\n\n                           (MORE)\n\n                       90B.\n\n\n\n          FATHER BRENDAN (TO THE CONGREGATION)\n\nBesides his irreverent humor and\n\nalarming honesty, he always did the\n\nunexpected.\n\n\n\nIn nearly every aspect of his life,\n\nMark did the unexpected. His was a\n\ndynamic voice in a paralyzed body,\n\na full life lived long after he\n\nshould have been dead.
