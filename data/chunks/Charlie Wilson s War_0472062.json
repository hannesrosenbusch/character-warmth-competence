FANTASY SUITE, CAESAR'S PALACE - NIGHT\n\nWe'll get to the hot tub in a second. The first thing we need\nto know is that there's a large television nearby that's on\nbut that no one's paying attention to. At the moment it's\nshowing a commercial for a shampoo called Gee, Your Hair\nSmells Terrific. Men are passing women on the street and\ntelling them that, \"Gee, your hair smells terrific.\"\n\nWe don't care, 'cause the rest of the room is populated with\nhot women who'll be having sex with strangers tonight. The\nsound of the shampoo commercial is easily overtaken by The\nFine Young Cannibals. Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows we\ncan see the lights of the Strip and a couple of room service\nWAITERS are wheeling in another table of booze, ice and\nglasses.\n\nIn the large jacuzzi are PAUL BROWN, 40 and wants to be\nyounger; LIZ WICKERSHAM, a recent Playboy cover model; two\nSTRIPPERS who may or may not be wearing any clothes right now\nand our star, CHARLIE WILSON.\n\nJoints make their way around the room, as do small mirrors\nwith lines.\n\nPAUL BROWN isn't a real player and CHARLIE knows it, but he'll\ndo his best to humor the guy for LIZ's sake.\n\nBROWN\nIt'd be like Dallas.\n\nLIZ\nThat's xight.\n\n(CONTINUED)\n\f \n\n|\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n(2)\n\nBROWN\nYeah.\n\nCHARLIE\nTell me when to watch, I'll make sure I'm\nhome.\n\nBROWN\nYou don't think I can make it happen?\n\nCHARLIE\nI don't know anything about how any of\nthat works.\n\nBROWN\nI do.\n\nLIZ\n(to CHARLIE)\nYou said you'd listen to him, that's why\nwe're here.",
