The Pastor reaches out,\n\nholds Tomica's hand in one hand, Eazy's hand in the other.\n\n\n\n                    PASTOR (CONT'D)\n\n          Tomica Woods, do you take Eric\n\n          Wright to be your lawfully wedded\n\n          husband, to have and to hold...\n\n\n\nTomica tries not to cry, but it's impossible. The tears flow,\n\nand all she can do is wipe them away. Eazy won't stop looking\n\nat Tomica. Like she's the last thing he'll ever see.\n\n                                                                138.\n\n\n\n\n\n137   EXT.

Holding candles.\n\n      Many of them are crying. Holding pictures of Eazy.\n\n\n\n138   INT.

Looks down at his friend, whom he\n\n      hasn't seen in four years: Eazy's eyes are closed, a\n\n      RESPIRATOR doing his breathing for him.\n\n\n\n      NOTE: The BONE TAPE is still sitting, untouched, on the\n\n      bedside table. Eazy never got a chance to listen to it.\n\n\n\n      Dre stands there, staring down, in this extended, surreal\n\n      moment. He bends down, so his mouth is close to Eazy's ear.\n\n\n\n                          DRE\n\n                    (softly)\n\n                Yo, Eazy.
