Since you’ve asked me..\n\nFROST throws down his clip-board..\n\nFROST\n..there are three things the American\nPeople would like to hear you say.\nOne, there was probably more than\nmistakes. There was wrongdoing - yes,\nit might have been a crime too.\nSecondly, I did abuse the power I had\nas President. And thirdly, I put the\nAmerican people through two years of\nagony and I apologize for that. And I\nknow how difficult it is for anyone to\nadmit that - most of all you.
