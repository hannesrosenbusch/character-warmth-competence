Can you do that?\n\nTRIS\nNot unless you EXPLAIN some of this\nto me, Mom. You want me to go to\nthe Erudites, at least give me a\nreason.\n\nNATALIE\nI’m sorry, I can’t. I have to\nleave, but tell your brother, and\ndon’t seem attached to me, or your\nbrother.\n\nTRIS\nI don’t care what I look to them.\n\nNATALIE\nBut you have to. YOU MUST. I\nsuspect they are already monitoring\nyou. Have a piece of cake for me,\nall right? The chocolate. It’s\ndelicious, baked by Tori, we had a\ngood long history.\n\f37.\n\nNATALIE runs off into the distance, and TRIS follows. NATALIE\nclimbs up the wall with ease, and on the ankle of foot, a\ntattoo. TRIS sees, and her eyes widen, and she runs after\nNATALIE.\n\nTRIS\nMom? Were you Dauntless?\n\nNATALIE is no where to be seen.\n\nINT.

Especially her, her\nresult was manually logged, and\nAbnegation.\n\nERIC\nBut, she displays perfect Dauntless\nprinciples, I expected much less\nthan what I have seen from her. I\ndon’t think she will be a problem,\nshe is not a problem to us, I don’t\nthink she displays the attributes.\nHer slugging of Molly was\nparticularly brutal, and Dauntless.\n\nJEANINE\nTrust me, remember my IQ is so much\nhigher than yours. I got you this\njob, you know why we selected you\nto carry out the Erudite\ncollaboration with the Dauntless. I\ntrust I know where your loyalties\nlie.",
