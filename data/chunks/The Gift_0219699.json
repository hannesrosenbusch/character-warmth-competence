A car tops the hill, barely sees\nthe boys in time, SCREECHES and swerves and HONKS.\n\fAn old woman and a three-year-old boy come out in the yard closest to the boys.

It is a calm and soothing room.\n\fThey sit down across from each other at a little desk. on the desk is a deck of small cards, which\nAnnie begins to shuffle.

They are ESP cards, with four different symbols on\nthem: a cross, a square, a circle, and four wavy lines.
