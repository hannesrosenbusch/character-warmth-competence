His jacket is good tweed but\nworn and baggy. He wears a Tattersall vest of brilliant colors which\nseems wonderfully right on Parnell -- a reflection of a young heart\nand love of life. As Parnell tosses the drink off, Toive watches him\nwith a gentle compassion, Parnell now fumbles in his various pockets\nfor some money.\n\nPARNELL\n(continues)\nToivo, I'm afraid I'm going to have to\npay my bar bill tomorrow.\n\nToo... 2\nYou're good with me, Mr. McCarthy,-- —-—... -—-_.\n\nPARNELL\nThank you, Toivo. ,\n\nHe straightens his old Homburg hat, smooths out the Tattersall vest\nand heads for the door.\n\nPARNELL\n(continues)\nGood night, Toivo.\nTOIVO\nGood night, Mr. McCarthy.\n\nEXT, PAUL'S HOME AND OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nQn the main street -- the lights of the business district in the distance,\n\nPaul's car approaches the old, two-storied house -= swings into the\ndriveway.

In the outer office another open door\nleads into the lighted hallway. Paul is seen in the hallway reading\nthe note on the antlers. Not disturbing the note, he enters the outer\noffice, passes through into the private office. He turns on a standing\nlamp. Illuminated, this office is quite a large room -- was once.a\ndining room.

Against one wall is an\nancient black leather couch and on a small safe in a corner a portable\nrecord player with a well-stocked album rack. Near the safe is an old\nupright piano against the wall, the panel missing, revealing its\nmusical works. The round dining table, left over from times past,\n\nis stacked with law books and legal journals. Paul deposits his\nfishing gear on the table, lifts a brown paper sack from his coat ,\npocket, stands it on the table. The sack contains the shape of a\nbottle. He opens a closet door, and on the inside of the door is fixed\na canvas panel on which are fastened myriad trout lures. Paul\nremoves the lures from his hat, hooks them into the canvas, The\nlast is a brightly colored Royal Coachman. He affectionately blows\non its pretty feathers before fastening it to the panel.
