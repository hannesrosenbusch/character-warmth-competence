It goes like this:\n\n           ...A bear's taking a shit, like, out in the\n\n           woods one day. And he sees this rabbit,\n\n           also taking a shit. The rabbit, wait, I\n\n           mean, the bear, he's shitting up a storm,\n\n           cuz he's been eating Mexican. The\n\n           wiping's taking forever, and his shit\n\n           keeps sticking to his fur. Wait, what\n\n           happens next? Oh, right-- he asks the\n\n           rabbit if he ever has trouble wiping. The\n\n           rabbit says no, shit just slides right\n\n           off him. So the bear picks the rabbit up\n\n           and wipes his ass with him.\n\n           (pause, as if for applause)\n\n           Well, I never said it was a good joke.\n\n           And see, that makes it perfect, because\n\n           it's pretty much the story of my life.\n\n                         \n\n           We can now see that he's perched on a stool, wearing a REM t-\n\n           shirt and old jeans.
