CABIN - GALLEY - DAY\n\n                         \n\n          WHIP exits the lavatory drying his hands with a towel. He\n\n          looks down the aisle to see TRINA far down the cabin. TRINA\n\n          sees WHIP, comes back up the aisle and stands with her back\n\n          to him watching the passengers.\n\n                         \n\n          WHIP opens a bottle of orange juice and takes a big swig. He\n\n          then pours half of it in the sink. WHIP places the open\n\n          juice bottle on the liquor cart, reaches up, and grabs the\n\n          cabin mic to address the passengers.\n\n                         \n\n                          WHIP\n\n           Folks, this is Captain Whitaker.\n\n           If you look up, I'm here in the\n\n           galley.

Whip shakes the juice as he\n\n          tosses the little empties into the galley trash.

Next\n\n          to the photos is a small CD station that NICOLE taps to life\n\n          and turns up. The opening bars of Michael Fitzpatrick's\n\n          \"Medication\" begin to play.\n\n                         \n\n          We pull wide to see NICOLE pull the bra from her arm that she\n\n          used to tie off with. Her face is pure happiness.\n\n                         \n\n          Clothes and a peach crate filled with camera equipment join a\n\n          suitcase on its side that acts as a coffee table.

She laughs and hums, pulls out gum,\n\n          a brush...She's holding the brush when the first heavy wave\n\n          of narcotic death washes over her. She leans back and uses\n\n          the wall for support. \"Medication\" is hitting its chorus...\n\n           24.\n\n                         \n\n                          NICOLE\n\n           Oh man...\n\n                         \n\n          She puts her arms out at her sides, euphoria. A slow, sloppy\n\n          smile breaks across her face. She exhales slowly. She\n\n          reaches for the now burning cigarette when the second wave of\n\n          heavy drugs hits. NICOLE looks up with fear.\n\n                         \n\n           NICOLE (cont'd) (CONT'D)\n\n           Oh no, oh no, oh no...\n\n                         \n\n          She reaches for the little bag of coke that KIP gave her.\n\n          Next she grabs her phone, flipping it open. As she tries to\n\n          dial it, she crumbles to her knees. NICOLE somewhat controls\n\n          her fall to the ground, but her eyes are fading. The little\n\n          bag of coke falls from her fingers.\n\n                         \n\n          There's no way to stem the tide of the oncoming overdose.\n\n          NICOLE's arms stretch out in a frozen reach as her body sinks\n\n          to the floor. On her back like a girl making angels in the\n\n          snow as her eyelids flutter, she slips away.\n\n                         \n\n          We hear a pounding on the door.",

The loss of the\n\n           elevator was, and I quote our\n\n           report, a \"catastrophic event, from\n\n           which recovery was improbable and\n\n           stable flight impossible.\"\n\n                         \n\n          Everyone goes quiet as those words resonate.
