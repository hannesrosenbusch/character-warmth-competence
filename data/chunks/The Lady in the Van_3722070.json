DAY (1960) 1\n\nA country lane c. 1960 with MISS SHEPHERD at the wheel of a\nvan barrelling along, her face set and anxious. Distantly we\nhear the sound of a police siren (or bell it would be in\n1960). She pulls the van into a side road or clearing and\nwaits, ducking behind the seat as she sees the police car\npass the end of the road. MISS SHEPHERD rights herself,\nchecks the side of the van. Wipes her hand on it. Blood. She\ncrosses herself. Then starts up the van and drives off the\nway she has come.\n\nAs she turns the corner, we see that the police car has\nstopped at the end of the road. A solitary policeman,\nUNDERWOOD, gets out of the car and watches the van disappear.\n\nROLL TITLES over —\n\nINT. CONCERT HALL.
