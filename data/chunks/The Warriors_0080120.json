His toughness\nis as much of an attitude as physical aptitude\n++-Fast of foot, a perfect scout on military\nmissions. Rembrandt's best friend.\n\nSWAN\nThe War Chief. Laconic by nature. Very tough,\nvery resourceful...a natural military tactician.\nHe combines shrewdness and physical courage. By\nchoice a loner, he dislikes the necessity of\ntaking command...\n\nREMBRANDT\nThe Marker or Artist. The shyest member of the\nWarriors; small kinetic, somewhat reserved.\nHe can climb anywhere, move silently...The\nyoungest of the patrol...\n\nCOCEISE\nA reugh and ready street boy who has a simple\napproach to his existence, fight and fornicate\n~--+A soldier and a good one.\n\nCOWBOY\nWears a Stetson.

Not always a disciplined\nsoldier, he complains a lot before he bops,\nbut he's always there...\n\nSNOWBALL\n\nTall, lean; the face and body of a Masai warrior\n---Disciplined, yet an attitude that suggests\nindependence. He never speaks. ,\n\f   \n \n\nHis attitude is cantankerous at best, rebellious\nwith more than overtones of cruelty at the ~\n‘worst ... Proud of his physical strength, he most.\ndislikes: The Fox among the othex Warriors, ©. .-5.\nalthough Swan rums a close second ..- a natural.\ninclination for mixing violence and sex.",
