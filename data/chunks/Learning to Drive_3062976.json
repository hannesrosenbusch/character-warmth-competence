Attractive but careless about her looks.\n\nThe hallway is lined with bookcases. Piles of messengered\nbooks and mail are on the hall table, and a bowl full of keys\nand coins.

TAXI COMPANY - LATER — PRE-DAWN 12\n\nBack in Queens, Darwan returns the taxi. He removes his\nbelongings, and checks the rear seat. He sees a PADDED\nENVELOPE ON THE FLOOR. One of his passengers must have left\nsomething.\n\nThere is no name on the outside of the envelope. The flap is\nopen. He slips his hand in and pulls out a new HARDCOVER\nBOOK.
