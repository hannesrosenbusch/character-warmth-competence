By manipulating the genetic \n\t\tinformation in a common blood cell and infusing it \n\t\twith the characteristics of a potent virus, they were \n\t\table to create a biological warrior cell--the viragene. \n\t\tOnce introduced into a host, the viragene could hunt \n\t\tand obliterate the body's natural enemies--tumors, \n\t\tthickening arteries, decaying bone. Anything. The \n\t\t'enemy' would be consumed, digested, and \n\t\ttransformed into energy to fuel the viragene. It was a \n\t\tperfect tool. And the possibilities were limitless. AIDS, \n\t\tcancer, muscular dystrophy, even the flu--the viragene\n\t\tcould beat them all.\n\n\t\tThe first human trials began in March of 1998. The\n\t\tinitial trial group, dubbed the 'Krippen Ten', were \n\t\tafflicted with leukemia. These individuals, along with \n\t\tDr. Krippen, were about to make more than medical \n\t\thistory. They were to forever change the course of \n\t\thumanity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Being unconquerable lies with yourself; being conquerable lies with the \nenemy.\"\n\nSun Tzu, The Art of War.\n\n\n\"We used to wonder where war lived, what it was that made it so vile. And now \nwe realize\nthat we know where it lives. That it is inside ourselves.\"\n\nAlbert Camus, Notebooks.\n\n\n\"'Let there be light!' said God, and there was light.

(remembering)\n\t\tEvery year for my birthday, my wife Ellen would throw\n\t\tme a party.  A kid's party.  Cake, ice cream, funny hats,\n\t\t\"Pin the Tail on the Donkey\".  One year she rented a pony.\n\t\tIt didn't matter that we were grown-ups and this was all\n\t\tkind of silly to the neighbors.

When someone finds these tapes...\n\t\tYou will know who I was.  What I was about.\n\t\tWhat I tried to do.  What I try to do.

He collapses \nthe tripod and rests the apparatus in a corner.  He wears shorts, a t-shirt, \ntennis shoes.  He slices a CD into an impressive MUSIC SYSTEM and Mahler's \n\"Resurrection\" Symphony BLASTS from speakers throughout the house.\n\n\nINT.  NEVILLE'S HOUSE - EXERCISE ROOM - DAY\n\nA serious workout facility.  Weights, boxer's heavy bag, rowing machine, etc.  \nNeville pushes himself through a series of strenuous exercises.  His body is \nin fantastic shape.  Taught muscle.  Lean, not bulky.  His movements are \nlithe, almost graceful.  More track athlete than body builder.\n\n\nINT.",

A few are the results of crude stitches, the others...  \nBite marks ?  Scratches ?\n\n\nINT.  NEVILLE'S HOUSE - LIBRARY - DAY\n\nNeville passes shelves filled with COMPACT DISCS, AUDIO CASSETTES, and \nVIDEOTAPES.  Another section filled with BOOKS and PAINTINGS.  Only a \ncarefully selected few hang on the walls--Degas, Klee, Rothko, Van Gogh.  The \nrest are stacked like pallets.  They must be copies.  Mustn't they?\n\nA TELEVISION gives us the \"Today Show\", A RADIO, NPR's \"Morning Edition\", \n\"Resurrection\" in the background.  A wall of sound.  The sound of everyday \nlife.  Normal life. Neville descends a SPIRAL STAIRCASE leading to the GROUND \nFLOOR.\n\n\nINT.  NEVILLE'S HOUSE - GREENHOUSE - DAY\n\nNeville strolls the aisles of a hothouse.  Vegetables, fruit, herbs, \npotatoes.  All in carefully compartmentalized lots.  Panes of glass on the \nroof allow in SUNLIGHT.\n\nNeville notices a loose screw on a shutter and pulls a SQUARE of METAL from \nhis pocket.  It's an ALL-IN-ONE-TOOL--something Neville is never without.  \nOnly two inches-by-two inches, it has a screwdriver tip, a serrated 'saw' \nedge, a knife edge, magnifying glass, etc.\n\nNeville tightens the screw, holds the tool in his teeth--a habit--and makes \nsure the window is shut tight.  Neville picks a few strawberries, checks the \nCondition of a tomato plant, and trims a vine with the knife side of the \ntool.\n\n\nINT.

We know these stories.  There's \nnothing \"new\" about the news.)\n\nOutside, we HEAR a DOG BARKING.\n\nNeville enters a ROOM adjacent to the kitchen--a state-of-the-art MEDICAL \nFACILITY. Operating table, pharmacy, I.V.s, EKG, surgical equipment, you name \nit.  He uses a hypodermic to withdraw BLOOD from his arm.  He fills two \nplastic vials and tosses the syringe into a BIOHAZARD waste bin.\n\n\nINT.  NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY\n\nSpartan.  Bed, reading lamp, a few books.  A PHOTO of his wife and child. on \nthe wall, an HISTORICAL PAINTING showing Napoleon's surrender at Waterloo.  \nNearby, within a second's grasp from bedside, are a SHOTGUN and a .44 MAGNUM.\n\nAt a closet filled with very few clothes--all the same type--Neville loses \nthe robe and steps into a BLACK TIGHT-FITTING BODYSUIT.  Similar to a diver's \nwetsuit, but the material is more flexible.  It's some type of protective \nundergarment, composed of a Kevlar-like mesh.\n\nHe dons a Kevlar vest, a work shirt and durable pants.  He slips on combat \nboots, tucks the pants into them, and TAPES THEM . He adds a \"utility\" belt \nand fits the BLOOD VIALS into a secure pouch.  He straps on two wristwatches \nand chains an ELECTRONIC POCKET WATCH to his belt.  Again, the DOG BARKS \noutside.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEVILLE\n\t\tAll right, all right.

NEVILLE'S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY\n\nA no-frills underground garage.  A LAND ROVER, SPORTS CAR, and MOTORCYCLE. \n(Now shut off, the walls are lined with HALOGEN LAMPS.) Neville walks to an \nelectronic control panel and hits a button.  The garage door opens, but it \ndoesn't open vertically.  Instead, a horizontal panel slides back, parallel \nwith the earth's surface, revealing a slanted cement ramp leading to the \ngarage below.\n\nSUNLIGHT pours in from above.  The DOG BARKS.  A MUSCULAR CANINE silhouetted \nat the top.  Neville WHISTLES.  The dog bounds down the ramp, delighted to \nsee its master.  Neville reacts coldly.  No, \"Hi, boy, how ya doin'?!\" \nNothing.  We know the dog wants a reaction, but Neville is firm.  He opens a \nCABINET, grabs a bag, and pours some chow.  The dog hungrily devours his \nbreakfast and Neville sees the bag is empty.  He opens ANOTHER and finds it's \nCRAWLING WITH ANTS.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEVILLE\n\t\tTerrific.\n\nHe dumps the infested bag into a trash Container.  Neville whistles and \npoints to the Land Rover.  The dog leaps into the vehicle.  Neville shuts the \npassenger door and we see the Rover has been customized.  The roof, hood, \ndoors, and trunk are crisscrossed with BARBED WIRE.  All windows--save the \nwindshield, and that is protected by chicken wire--have been replaced by \nTHICK METAL PLATES.  SLITS are cut into the steel, but visibility is limited.\n\n\nINT.  LAND ROVER - DAY\n\nNeville climbs behind the wheel.  The interior of the vehicle is outfitted \nwith emergency medical supplies, flares, heavy-duty flashlights, lamps, rope, \nwire, tools.

We vaguely recognize the road as one of streets \nof SAN FRANCISCO, but something's wrong.  The road is in great disrepair and \nlittered with debris.  The trees are barren, the area deathly silent, and \nthere is absolutely no other traffic.\n\n\nINT.  LAND ROVER - DAY\n\nNeville continues to listen to Resurrection an the Rover's CD player.

RADIO STATION - DJ BOOTH / CONTROL ROOM - DAY\n\nNeville adjusts the mixing panel and takes a seat behind a microphone. \n(Throughout this scene we will notice that the radio station looks like a \ntornado blew through it.)\n\n\t\t\t\tNEVILLE\n\t\tGood Morning San Francisco.

How 'bout \n\t\tgiving me a call?  1-800-F-U-C-K-Y-O-U.\n\nHe glances to his right.  The Telephone switchboard panel is shattered, dead, \ncovered with dust.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEVILLE\n\t\tWow.

Melancholy and haunting.\n\n\nEXT.  DOWNTOWN STREETS- VARIOUS - DAY\n\nMUSIC CONTINUES as the Land Rover cruises through the heart of the city.  We \ndon't spend much time here and it's frustrating, because we can't fully \ncomprehend the visual make-up of downtown.  The streets are deserted, litter \nand dust blow freely with the wind and the buildings look ravaged.  Looted?  \nBurned?  Destroyed by earthquake?\n\n\nEXT.  PET STORE - DAY\n\nNeville and the dog exit the Rover and for the first time we notice Neville \nwears a shoulder holster containing a .45 automatic. and carries an M-16 \nmachine gun.  A high-intensity flashlight is attached to the machine gun \nbarrel and extra ammo clips taped to its handle.\n\n\nINT.

Scans the area.  Absolutely no one in \nsight.  Forlornly, he stares at the ground, the cracks in the pavement... \nAlone.\n\n\nEXT.  DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY\n\nThe streets are abandoned, buildings deserted.  The Land Rover parked at an \nintersection, the dog on lookout.  Neville stands beneath a lamp post, a coil \nof WIRE over his shoulder.  He measures a length, tosses it over the arm of \nthe post, and creates an old-fashioned SNAPE out of the cable.  He adjusts, \ntightens, and pulls one of the vials of blood from his utility belt.  He \ntakes a rag, douses it with the blood, and positions it as \"bait\" in the \nsnare.

Neville \nshouts...\n\n\t\t\t\tNEVILLE\n\t\tGET OUT OF THE STREET!\n\nThe dog continues to , its eyes on a specific section of the building.  \nNeville steals a glance and sees a RIFLE BARREL poking out of a shattered \nwindow frame.

The only light is a tiny shaft \ncoming through the cracked pane the shooter is using for his rifle.\n\nThe shooter himself is bundled in rags.
