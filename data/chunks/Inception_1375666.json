As Cobb\n\ntakes it back, he spots Ariadne at the next counter. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n She nods\n\nat him. He nods back. Then moves off...\n\n\n\nAs Cobb passes through baggage claim, he exchanges subtle\n\ngreetings with Eames and Yusuf.\n\n\n\nArthur smiles broadly at Cobb. Cobb brushes past Fischer, who\n\nglances back at him as if thinking maybe he should know him,\n\nthen moves on...\n\n                                                          146.\n\n\n\nAs Cobb emerges into the crowded arrivals hall, he spots\n\nProfessor Miles, waving at him...\n\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN, COBB AND MAL'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n\n\nCobb enters with Miles. Drops his bags. Moves to the table,\n\nlooking out at the overgrown garden. He reaches into his\n\npocket, takes out his pewter spinning top, lowers it to the\n\ntable and SPINS IT- a CHILD'S SHOUT makes him look up-\n\n\n\nThrough the window, James and Philippa have run into view,\n\nplaying, THEIR FACES TURNED AWAY... Cobb STARES at the back\n\nof his children's heads... Miles moves to the window and\n\nKNOCKS on the glass-\n\n\n\nJames and Philippa TURN- see their Dad. He steps to the\n\nwindow, watching their BRIGHT FACES SHINING as they run\n\ntowards him...\n\n\n\nBehind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING.\n\nAnd we-\n\n\n\nFADE OUT.\n\n\n\nCREDITS.\n\n\n\nEND.\n\n"
