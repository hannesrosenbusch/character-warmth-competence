WAGGNER’S TV SPEECH\n\nWe've all heard people talk about “animal magnetism”, about the “natural\nman” and the “noble savage”. As if we had lost something valuable in our\nlong evolution into civilized human beings -- and there’s a good reason for\nthis. Man is a combination of the learned and the instinctual, of the\nsophisticated and the primitive. We should never try to deny the beast, the\n\nanimal, within us -- only to channel these energies in a positive\ndirection.\nAll of us have a great untapped potential -- a potential for living. What\n\nwe do with that potential, with that life, depends as much on our attitudes\ntoward our physical desires as it does on the social programming of our\nminds. The struggle between mind and body is not a necessary one. It\nproduces anger, frustration, the strain of modern-day living in a world\nthat’s moving too quickly toward its own annihilation. Stress results when\nwe fight against our impulses, when we attempt to destroy the natural man\nor woman within us. Repression is the father of neurosis, of self-hatred.\n\nLet me say a few words about my new book, THE GIFT. When we’re born, each\nof us is given a gift -- the gift of life.....\n\nCONTINUED:\n\nDOC\n\nWe've all heard people talk about “animal magnetism”, about the “natural\nman” and the “noble savage”.
