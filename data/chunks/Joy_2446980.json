Can you ask\nmy dad to take off the mop head and\nput it back on?\n\nRudy tries to take the mop head off. He can’t figure out\nwhere the button is. He tries a few different unsuccessful\nways.\n\nJOY (CONT'D)\nMay I?\n\nJoy takes the mop and detaches the mop head in a millisecond.\nShe then puts it back on and works the wringer. She turns to\nthe judge.\n\f131.\n\nJUDGE\nMr. Martorella, you may sit down.\n\nRudy goes back to his chair. Joy goes back to her table and\nturns to the judge, matter of fact.\n\nJOY\n\nThis mop isn’t the first thing I’ve\ninvented.",
  "85": "END OF PREVIOUSLY ANNOTATED SECTION:\nRudy goes back to his chair. Joy goes back to her table and\nturns to the judge, matter of fact. JOY\n\nThis mop isn’t the first thing I’ve\ninvented. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\n Its just the first thing\nanyone has ever bought. Its really\namazing seeing people buy this\nthing. It makes me feel something\nI’ve never felt before. Proud. I’m\nsure these guys have that same\nfeeling. Because they have the\n‘paperwork’ right there that says\nthey own, conceived, and created my\nmop. They were the ones slipping on\nthe floor of Sam’s Diner at\nmidnight. They were the ones that\nfigured out you need to put a pin\nin the mop or it won’t work right.\nOr that if you slip your finger\nover the housing when you’re\nassembling it, you’ll get your skin\npinched every time. Right guys?\nThey have to know about the skin\npinching. Because they have the\npaperwork. It says this mop is\ntheirs. You could tell by the way\nthey talk about it. Its personal\nfor them. It’s their blood, sweat,\nand tears. I don’t have that\npaperwork. It was taken out from\nunderneath me. While I was busy\ntrying to make this thing happen, I\nwas betrayed. And I guess honesty\nand integrity don’t have a receipt.\nThere’s no patent for hard work.\n\n(beat)\nMy whole life people have been\ntelling me you can’t do this and\nyou shouldn’t try that and you\ndon’t deserve this. It’s been like\nnoise in my head for a very long\ntime. I just wanna walk away from\nall the noise. To you, it’s a mop.\nTo me, it’s a way out. All I’m\nasking for, your honor, is what has\nalways been mine. And the paperwork\nto prove it. Thank you.\n\nThe judge nods. He is quiet for a long time. He calls the\nbailiff over and whispers to him. The bailiff walks out of\nthe room, then comes back with more paperwork. Joy watches\nevery move. The judge finally speaks.\n\f132.\n\nJUDGE\nWhere are these mop molds being\nheld?\n\nMATTY’S LAWYER\nIn California at our Avalon\nfacility.\n\nJUDGE\nOkay.",

It is to\nbe re-filed in the name of Joy\nMangano.\n\nThere is an audible reaction from the room. He turns to Joy.\n\nJUDGE (CONT'D)\nGood luck to you.\n\nHe hits the gavel. Ronnie bursts into tears. Everyone on\nJoy's side erupts in celebration. Ronnie, runs to Joy, they\nhug each other. They all hug. Joy hugs Toots, who is\ncompletely dumbfounded. She hugs Ronnie very tightly.\n\f133.\n\nAs she hugs Ronnie, Joy looks over Ronnie’s shoulder, across\nthe room to Rudy.\n\nRudy sits isolated, no longer part of the family, no longer\nrespected by the mob. Shamed. He looks pathetic. Joy\nwatches him. A hint of sympathy comes across her face.\n\nJoy's group excitedly starts to head out the door. Last in\nline, Joy stops where Rudy is sitting. A beat. Then...\n\nJOY\nWe gonna see you for dinner on\nSunday?\n\nRUDY\n\nYeah. Yeah that’d be good.\n\nINT. JOY’S OFFICES. CHYRON: 1 YR LATER.\n\nJoy is walking through what are now STATE-OF-THE-ART OFFICES.\nShe is made-over, a new and improved version of herself.\nConfident, polished, elegant. Ronnie comes up to her, wearing\na business suit. Ronnie talks to her as they walk.\n\nRONNIE\nJoy, Dante’s on his way with the\nkids for pizza night.\n\nJOY\nGreat.",

The kids are almost here.\nMeet us in the green room in 20\nminutes for pizza?\n\nTONY\n(smiling)\nYeah.\n\nJoy smiles, exits his office. She walks to a door that has a\ndecorative grapevine wreath hanging on it. She enters. On the\nwall is a WOMAN’S DAY MAGAZINE COVER that has been framed\nwith JOY AND HER KIDS on the cover. “Mother of Invention”.\n\nJoy opens the closet, takes her blazer off, and hangs her\nblazer up. The blazer slides off and falls to the floor. She\nhangs it again. It slides off again. Joy holds the hanger up,\nstares at it, slides her fingers along the corners of the\nhanger, and we go off on her, wheels turning...a new\ninvention is brewing!\n\nCHYRON:\n\nIn the next few years the Miracle Mop sold over 10 million\nunits.\n\nIt’s sales were only outdone by Joy’s next invention: The\nHuggable Hanger.\n\nToday Joy's products have grossed over a half billion in\nsales.\n\f135.\n\nIf you asked her today, she would say her proudest\nachievement is her children.\n\f136.\n\f"
