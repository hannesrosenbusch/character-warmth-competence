I’d brought with me Ian McEwan’s novel\nAtonement: | always look forward to his books, and this longish novel, I thought,\nmight be the ideal distraction from the gathering conviction that a piece\nlike Ambler’s The Night-Comers—which deals with the quiet, deadly power\nstruggle in Indonesia between moderate and fundamentalist Moslems—would,\nin the current climate, never even reach the starting gate. So, sitting by the\nhotel pool, far from the prewar English country landscapes so vividly\nevoked in the novel, I felt myself sinking into the world of Briony Tallis, so\nentranced that I could scarcely bring myself to move when the fierce sun\nshifted and fell across my feet or shoulders.\n\nBy the time I came back to England, I was convinced that, complex and\ninteriorized as it was, the novel could still be the basis of a powerful film. I\ncontacted my agent, who told me that several writers were already inter-\nested in the project and that Ian, who had retained a position as Executive\nProducer, had reserved the right to interview, vet, or otherwise audition the\ncandidates. A dinner was arranged with Richard Eyre, an old friend and\ncolleague of both Ian and myself; Robert Fox, the producer; and Ian. I gave\na somewhat halting (and, in retrospect, totally inaccurate) account of the\napproach I was thinking of adopting and, in due course, to my great excite-\nment, was offered the job.\n\nOver the next couple of years, I produced three or four drafts, each of\nwhich was analysed and dissected in meetings at Richard’s house, before being\ndiscussed in considerable detail with Ian.",

I gave\na somewhat halting (and, in retrospect, totally inaccurate) account of the\napproach I was thinking of adopting and, in due course, to my great excite-\nment, was offered the job. Over the next couple of years, I produced three or four drafts, each of\nwhich was analysed and dissected in meetings at Richard’s house, before being\ndiscussed in considerable detail with Ian. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n In the version that emerged, the\n\fstory was framed by the return of Briony Tallis, celebrating her seventy-\nseventh birthday, to the country hotel into which her childhood home had\nbeen converted; the voice of the old writer, whose actions one blazing\nsummer’s day in 1935 had profoundly affected, not to say blighted, her\nown life and the lives of those most precious to her, was heard from time\nto time, reflecting on the implications of this or that event, while she her-\nself was glimpsed occasionally like a ghost from the future; and the second\nand third sections of the novel (the flight to Dunkirk and Briony’s wartime\nservice in St. Thomas’s Hospital), which happen more or less simultaneously\nin time, were rearranged and interwoven. The intention was always to remain\nas faithful to the spirit of the novel as possible—I’m always baffled by the\nwidespread notion that when a high price has been paid for a much-loved\nplay or novel, the first thing to do is to set about it with a hacksaw—and to\ntranslate it into a calm and measured overview of a series of irredeemable\ncatastrophes, somewhat in the manner of Harold Pinter’s spare and heart\nbreaking account of L. P. Hartley’s The Go-Between.\n\nTime drifted on, and a familiar anguish began to make itself felt: the\nfear that for one or another unfathomable reason, the film might in the end\nnot be made. A pretty expensive art film about a writer and her very partic-\nular sufferings and temptations might well seem a hard sell, and eventually\nRichard Eyre moved away in the direction of a sure thing: his exquisitely acted\nand entertainingly malevolent version of Notes on a Scandal. It seemed to\nme as if a whale I’d been riding for a number of years was about to disap-\npear into the deep: and then I was called into the Working Title offices to\nmeet Joe Wright.\n\nJoe wasted no time in uttering one of those formulae that strike dread\ninto a screenwriter’s heart (others might include, “This is a really good first\ndraft” or “Who exactly are we supposed to be rooting for?”). He said: “I'd\nlike to start from scratch.” Furthermore, he meant it.",

Joe wasted no time in uttering one of those formulae that strike dread\ninto a screenwriter’s heart (others might include, “This is a really good first\ndraft” or “Who exactly are we supposed to be rooting for?”). He said: “I'd\nlike to start from scratch.” Furthermore, he meant it. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n But the good news\nwas he knew what he wanted: to bring the screenplay back even closer to\nthe form of the novel, and he had good, specific ideas of how this might be\ndone. For him the first move was to kick away the crutches: the explanatory\nvoice-overs, the framing device, the linearity of narrative. This would mean\nthat the story would have to be told primarily in images and that the actors’\nthoughts would have to be readable on their faces rather than audible on the\n\nvi\n\fsound track; and that, echoing the bold strategy of the book, we would be\ndealing in big, self-contained chunks of narrative, where the focus would shift\nunapologetically from one character to another.\n\nThis had one major unforeseen advantage: the twenty-minute gap between\nseeing Briony at thirteen and Briony at eighteen made it far easier to think\nof casting two separate actors, an idea that had not really occurred to us before,\nwhen our structure had appeared to insist on a teenage actor capable of\naging up and down. The reclaiming of the first half of the story, so that it\ncould be seen through the eyes of a genuine child, made an immeasurable dif-\nference to the understanding of Briony’s crime, if that is what it is. And the\nholding in reserve of old Briony, who now appears only in a relatively brief\nepilogue, means that the viewer of the film, no longer alerted by premoni-\n\ntory hints, can suffer the same dislocating shoc\nthe novel.\n\nThe entire process was long and arduous: a\nlowed by constant revision of one section or\n\n‘s at the end as the reader of\n\ncouple more full drafts, fol-\nanother, until finally, at the\n\nend of 2005, Joe and I went to spend two weeks on a property not far from\n\nFlorence, belonging to Susa Gelpke, an extreme’\n\nly sympathetic and hospitable\n\nfriend of Joe’s, out of which came a final draft which proved to me the\n\ntruth of something I had often heard asserted:\nconsuming or effortful than the work require\n\nnothing can be more time-\nto make a piece of writing\n\nseem simple, lucid, and effortless.",

There were to be no columns of refugees strafed by\nGerman Stukas, no Panzers rolling northwards, no carpet-bombing of the\nretreating armies. Instead, illustrating another old adage about the creativity\nunleashed by imposed limits, there would be three soldiers tramping north\nthrough a phantasmagorical landscape of literal death and dreams and mem-\n\nories of many other kinds of death. The teeming chaos of Dunkirk had to\n\n \n\nbe portrayed in a kind of composite scene, brilliantly organized by Joe into\na single, spectacularly executed Steadicam shot. Not exactly a case of less\nmeaning more, although it meant that the thousand extras were required only\n\nfor one day, it gave a genuine sense of sweep and size and a true feeling of\n\fthe sorrow and pity of war. Here and elsewhere I can say, almost as an\nobjective bystander, though with great pleasure and pride, that the film found\nits own compelling way of conveying the novel’s particularly eloquent bal-\nance of the epic and the intimate.\n\nA word about the text itself? what you have in your hands is a transcrip-\ntion, made after the event, of the finished film.

That’s why I\ncould finally write this book; and\nwhy, of course, it’s my last novel.\nStrangely enough, it would be just as\naccurate to call it my first novel.
