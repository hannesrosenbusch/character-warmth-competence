Swirls of newspapers blow across the street.\nSuddenly, a YELLOW SCHOOL BUS BECOMES VISIBLE, rising over a\nhill. As it gets nearer, we feel the ROAR of the engine.\nThe bus is a monster. As it rumbles by us we SEE \"SUNNY\nMEADOWS HIGH SCHOOL\" inscribed on the side.\n\nINSIDE THE SCHOOL BUS\n\nGrimy. Run down. School Bus Hell. Oppressed grey-faced\nHIGH SCHOOLERS sit round-shouldered, looking out into nowhere\nland.\n\nWE DOLLY SLOWLY ALONG the floor TO REVEAL all the students'\nankles SHACKLED and CHAINED to their seats. The faint rhythm\nof a FILE RUBBING AGAINST STEEL becomes louder and louder\nuntil the CAMERA STOPS ON a student's hands. Seconds away\nfrom filing through the lock on his shackle... FREEDOM.\n\nThe CAMERA TILTS UP TO REVEAL LES ANDERSON, sixteen, maybe\nseventeen. He's the only kid on the bus with a spark of life\nleft in him.\n\nAs the bus stops at a RED LIGHT, something catches Les' eye.\nLES' P.O.V. - THROUGH A GREASY WINDOW - A RED BLUR\n\nHe wipes the window, revealing a RED FERRARI 308 GIB parked\nbeside the bus, outside a CORNER GROCERY STORE. The T-ROOF\nis off, and all we CAN SEE are the LONGEST, MOST BEAUTIFUL\n\nLEGS lounging in the passenger seat. A GUY walks away from\nthe car into the store.\n\nLES\n\nlecks to the back of the bus, to the REAR DOOR, clearly\nmarked \"FOR EMERGENCY USE ONLY.\" He teeters on the edge of\nhis seat, about to make a move. He looks to the front of the\nbus, at the:\n\nBUS DRIVER\n\nA maniac: mid-40s, lousy toupee. He's been watching Les in\nhis rearview mirror the entire time.",

Les kicks at the door.\n\nA RED WARNING LIGHT on the Driver's dash flashes. An ALARM\nsounds. The Driver looks back, angrily. Then pushes a\nbutton.\n\nA STEEL BOLT slams across the door. Les slams through the 7\nback window -- diving out of the bus onto the street. Les\nbounces out of a COMMANDO ROLL and runs up the street to the\nFerrari.\n\nThe bus does a spectacular BOOTLEGGER'S turn. It's coming\nback.\n\nLES LOOKS INTO THE FERRARI\n\nKeys dangle from the ignition. In the passenger seat is the\nLEGGIEST BLONDE GIRL you've ever seen. The approaching bus\nbuilds speed. Les jumps into the car.\n\nShe smiles, seductively. He smiles back. They're in love.\n\nThe bus screams towards them. Les turns the ignition, pops\nthe clutch, then squeals into a right turn slicing onto a:\n\nQUIET TREE-LINED SUBURBAN STREET\n\nThe bus roars after them, barely making the turn, balancing\non two wheels.\n\nLES RACES DOWN THE STREET\n\nLooks at his speedometer: 70... 75... 80... 85. Maple trees\nwhip by like he's in a rocket ship. AWESOME! He looks up at\nhis rearview mirror. It's all yellow. Miraculously, the bus\nis right on his tail. Suddenly:\n\nA LITTLE BOY DELIVERING PAPERS\n\nHops the curb and bicycles across the street. Les, about to\nhit him, yanks the wheel left, practically tearing it off its\ncolumn. The bus bombs by, slicing the front tire off the\nbike. The LITTLE BOY is left there on his seat, spinning\naround acrobatically on his back tire.",

With one hand he downshifts to\naccelerate, with the other, he starts to light the girl's\ncigarette... She pulls his hand closer to her, looking into\nhis eyes.\n\nBut WAIT! Up ahead, by a GAS STATION, there's a HUGE PUDDLE\nOF WATER. But it's not water. It's GAS! A tank pumps gas\ninto a tanker fuel truck. GAS spews from a ruptured hose.\nSuddenly, we hear a BORING MONOTONE voice.\n\nVOICE OVER\nRemember. Be prepared and look\nahead. The driver must see the BIG\nPICTURE...\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT.

Together we will\nbring the running dog imperialists\nto their knees.",

And by the way,\nthe name is Natalie, not Natascha!\n\nShe walks away, leaving a stunned, and at last, speechless\nKarl.\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY\n\nFull speed ahead. NOT A SINGLE CAR IN SIGHT. The light\nturns yellow, then a quick red. The Caddie's wheels lock. A\nlennnnnng skid. Burnt rubber, as it screeches to a stop.\n\nINSIDE THE CADDIE\nRudy, Mom, and Dad, REBOUND from the sudden stop.\n\nDAD\n(pissed off)\nLes? What the hell are you doing?\nThere's not a damn car in sight.\n\nLES\nIt's a red light.\n\nDAD\nLes. We're rushing your mother to\nthe hospital, not a bridge game.\nGo through it! Just get us there.\n\nLes smiles, looks both ways, then tries to take off... Only\none problem: the engine is revving, but the Caddie's not\nmoving.\n\nDAD\nWhat happened?\n\nLES\nI don't know. I'm pressing on the\ngas, but it won't go anywhere.\n\nDAD\nIt sounds like the transmission.\n(frustrated)\nTry the other gears.\n\nLes tries them all. Nothing. Shifting into park, the car\nJOLTS BACKWARDS as he passes REVERSE.\n\n(CONTINUED )\n\f114.\nCONTINUED:\n\nLES\n(looking at Dad)\nOnly reverse works.\n\nDad doesn't like it. Mom is in more pain. She winces and\ngroans. Dad feels for her.\n\nDAD\nAlright, alright. But take it\neasy.\n\nLes loves it. He shifts into reverse, turns to look through\nthe back window, braces his arm behind the seat, and takes\noff.\n\nOUTSIDE THE CADDIE\n\nPopeye Doyle screeches the car around and peels away.\n\nEXT. STREETS - DAY\n\nThe Caddie, in reverse, bombs down the street, its right turn\nsignal on. In the left lane is a long WEDDING PROCESSION.\n\nINSIDE THE CADDIE\n\nMom is in great pain.

  "74": "---END OF PREVIOUS SECTION---\nIn the left lane is a long WEDDING PROCESSION. INSIDE THE CADDIE\n\nMom is in great pain. Les has to make the turn. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n He zips up\nto the front of the line, then makes a sweeping left turn\nfrom the middle lane, and because an OLD BLIND WOMAN is\nshuffling across the street, Les is forced to go up ons:\n\nTHE SIDEWALK\n\nBoxed in by parked cars, the Caddie bombs through Sunday\npapers and Sunday morning brunch tables. A WAITER putting a\nRED tablecloth down on a table dives out of the way, like a\nMatador teasing a bull. The Caddie flies through the\ntablecloth.\n\nA MOTORCYCLE COP ACROSS THE STREET\n\nwriting out a parking ticket, drops his pencil when he sees\nthe Caddie crash down off the sidewalk onto the street\njoining the traffic. The Cop jumps on his motorcycle,\nswitches on his siren, and rockets away.\n\nWITH THE CADDIE\n\nweaving in and out of traffic: left turns, right turns, it's\n\nincredible. We hear the SIREN. The Cop pulls up beside Les,\nwaving for him to pull over.\n\n(CONTINUED )\n\f115.\nCONTINUED:\n\nDad tries to signal to the Cop that Mom's pregnant. The Cop\nrealizes what's going on. He waves for Les to \"follow him,\"\nbut he hasn't been looking ahead. Suddenly, his front tire\nhits the back bumper of an ANTIQUE CONVERTIBLE. The Cop\nsomersaults over his handle bars into the car's front seat.\n\nThe DRIVER, a red-nosed Irishman, does a double-take, takes a\nleck at the flask he's been nipping on, smiles, and takes\nanother swig.\n\nBACK WITH THE CADDIE\n\nbulleting down the street. The hospital is in sight. Les\nhas to catch a yellow light. A WATER MAIN has burst.\nThere's a HUGE PUDDLE. IN REVERSE, Les rockets through the\nlight. Here comes the puddle... Has he learned his lesson?\n\nINSIDE THE CADDIE\n\nLes eases his foot off the brake and coasts through. Spray\nshoots out on either side, and SPLASHES through the back\nwindow, soaking Mom and Dad. Rudy loves it. Dad alternates\nbetween caring for Mom and fearing for his life.\n\nEXT. POLICE STATION - DAY\n\nDown the street from the hospital. Natalie leaves the\nprecinct.",

Natalie leaves the\nprecinct. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n She does a triple-take when she sees her family\nflash by backwards. She runs after them.\n\nSUDDENLY!!!\n\nA HUGE TRUCK backs out of a SKYSCRAPER CONSTRUCTION SITE. A\nTOWERING CRANE attempts to lift a HEAVY LOAD OF STEEL GIRDERS\nfrom the truck's flatbed. The girders hang out onto the\nstreet...\n\nThe Caddie's headed straight for them. We hear a SCREECH!\n\nEXT. CADILLAC - CLOSE ON THEIR FACES IN THE BACK WINDOW\n\nHorror, as there's nothing they can do, except pray... ten\nfeet, five feet, a foot... Les swoops the car safely around\nthe girders and then screeches to a stop in a tow zone, in\nfront of the hospital. The emergency driveway is clogged.\nNatalie runs to the car.\n\nTWO ORDERLIES dash out to the car with a WHEELCHAIR. Dad\nhelps Mom out. Rudy and Natalie watch. Les stays in the\ncar. They rush Mom up the walk into the hospital. Dad looks\nback. Les is standing by the destroyed Caddie, ashamed.\n\n(CONTINUED )\n\f116.\nCONTINUED:\n\nDAD\n(stern)\nCome here, Les.\n\nLes looks down.\n\nDAD\nLes. Come here!\n\nLes sheepishly makes his way over. Dad puts his arm around\nhim.\n\nDAD\nWhere did you learn to drive like\nthat?\n\nLES\n(relieved)\nI don't know, Dad. TI guess last\nnight.\n\nDAD\nIt must have been some crash\ncourse.\n\nLes laughs. Dad squeezes him, affectionately. The CAMERA\nCRANES UP TO a bird's-eye view, high above the scene. Dad,\nwith his arm around his son, disappears into the hospital.\n\nDAD\n(voice over)\nMaybe we can fix the car before\nGrandfather gets home. He'll never\nnotice.\n\nSuddenly, CONSTRUCTION WORKERS begin shouting, and then\nrunning for cover, scattering like ants. From the sky:\n\nTHE WHOLE BUNCH OF GIRDERS\n\nCRASH down on Grandfather's Cadillac, DEMOLISHING it.\n\nAs the dust settles, the CAMERA CRAWLS its way into the heap\nof junk until we CAN BARELY MAKE OUT the radio-tape deck.",
