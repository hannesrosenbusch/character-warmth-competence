He was always saying \n\n               the right thing at the right \n\n               moment, and standing up for me \n\n               when there was no reason to. Look \n\n               at his face now, when the sunlight \n\n               shines off his lower lip, like it \n\n               is the face of some sort of \n\n               statue. Strong and soft at the \n\n               same time. I never could figure \n\n               out what Scott was doing here with \n\n               us on the street in the first \n\n               place, like he was on some sort of \n\n               crusade, to help the poor. Because \n\n               he really did come from a rich \n\n               Portland family. I know because he \n\n               brought me to his house one day \n\n               and showed me around. I mean, wow, \n\n               they were rich I They even had a \n\n               swimming pool. Scott's the only \n\n               kid that I had ever met that had a \n\n               swimming pool.

The table \n\n     where Scott and Mike sit is in front of a large window, and it is \n\n     semi-circular in shape.

Even though there was no \n\n               future.

She was a \n\n               mean old chick. She was maybe \n\n               thirty now. Old, old. Somebody \n\n               once told me that in the past, \n\n               Mary had this enemy, a chick that \n\n               had turned her in. And Mary had \n\n               gone off and kicked this chick to \n\n               death right in the street in front \n\n               of everybody. I don't know if it's \n\n               true, but I watched out, Just in \n\n               case. I was afraid of Mary.

An instigator for my \n\n               bad behavior, I was trying to \n\n               change. Now that I have, and until \n\n               I change back   don't come near \n\n               me.\n\n\n\n     Bob feels the rejection like a shock. Stares at Scott for a \n\n     second, then he's pulled away by the bouncer.\n\n     \n\n     Ext.

There is a body on a slab in the middle of the \n\n     room that is covered with a sheet.\n\n     \n\n                         MIKE\n\n               Pigeon?\n\n     \n\n                         A BOY\n\n               Scottie Favor broke his heart.\n\n     \n\n                         GARY\n\n               He's gone now, either to Heaven or \n\n     to Hell.\n\n     \n\n                         JANE LIGHTWORK\n\n               Be sure it isn't to Hell.

And they were cold as \n\n               stone. And I checked the rest of \n\n               his body.

Maybe you can give him a \n\n               good burial.\n\n     \n\n     Budd cries.\n\n     \n\n     Mike exits.\n\n     \n\n     In the country, Mike looks at the road.\n\n     \n\n     He has visions of sagebrush and rock flying into the air as if \n\n     picked up by a big wind.\n\n     \n\n     Then he lies asleep by the side of the road.\n\n     \n\n                         MIKE'S VOICE\n\n               I suppose that a lot of kids like \n\n               me think that they have no home, \n\n               that home is a place where you \n\n               have a mom and a dad.\n\n     \n\n     Pause.\n\n     \n\n                         MIKE'S THOUGHTS\n\n               But home can be any place that you \n\n               want. Or wherever you can find   \n\n               My home is right here on the side \n\n               of this road, that I been to \n\n               before. I just know I been on this \n\n               fucking road one time before, you \n\n               know that?\n\n\n\n     Later, a car drives by Mike's sleeping body by the side of the \n\n     road. It turns around and stops next to Mike. A figure puts Mike \n\n     in his car and drives off down the road.\n\n     \n\n                         MIKE'S THOUGHTS\n\n               Sometimes I had thought that God \n\n               had not smiled on me, and had \n\n               given me a bum deal. And other \n\n               times, I had thought that God had \n\n               smiled on me. Like now. He was \n\n               smiling on me... for the time \n\n               being....\n\n     \n\n     Int. Car. Day.\n\n     \n\n     Scott is driving the car. He looks over at Mike sleeping.\n\n     \n\n     Ext. Desert. Day.\n\n     \n\n     The car disappears down the road.\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n"
