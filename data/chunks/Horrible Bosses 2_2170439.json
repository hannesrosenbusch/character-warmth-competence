HIGHWAY - MORNING\n\nFrom overhead, we see a Toyota Prius chugging along down the\nhighway.\n\nNICK (V.O.)\nWhen you’re the president of the\n98th largest financial services\ncompany in America you need to\nproject a certain image. An image\nof boldness, strength and\nconfidence.\n\nSuddenly, a brand new, shiny black Porsche Boxster\nconvertible ZOOMS around the Prius, leaving it in the dust.\n\nAs we move in, we see the driver of the Porsche is NICK\nHENDRICKS. Sunglasses. Top down. Wind in his hair. He\nlooks pretty cool.\n\nNICK (V.0O.)\nYou’re not gonna get that image\ndriving a Prius.\n\nEXT. COMNIDYNE PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER\n\nNick pulls into the lot and takes a reserved spot near the\nentrance with a sign that reads “NICK HENDRICKS, PRESIDENT.”\nHe gets out of the Porsche and removes the dealer’s paper\nfloormat from under the pedals.\n\nNICK (V.O.)\nI put in a lot of years to become\npresident of Comnindyne and now I’m\nearning a lot more and working a\nlot... more. The strange thing is,\nwhen I finally made it to the top,\nI realized that I’d actually only\nmade it to the bottom of the top.\n\nNick heads toward the building, passing several parking spots\nwith much more expensive sports cars (Ferrari, Porsche 911\nTurbo, Mercedes SLR McLaren) each with a sign bearing a name\nand the title “PRESIDENT.”\n\nNICK (V.O.)\nTurns out Comnidyne has seven\npresidents. And I’m the most\njunior.\n\nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MINUTES LATER\n\nNick enters to find his more senior COLLEAGUES in their\nmorning meeting.\n\fNICK\nHey, sorry I’m late.\n(holding up keys)\nHad to stop by the dealership to\npick up a little something.\n\nThe others all react, impressed.

She’s the Porsche.\n\nPETER\nBarely. You got a Boxster?\n\nNICK\nUh huh. Two-thousand thirteen.\n\nA sallow-looking woman, JEANINE, 50's, chimes in.\n\nJEANINE\nCost you that much?\n\nThe others all laugh derisively.\n\nNICK\nIt’s a great little car.\n\nPETER\nThat’s adorable. You’re a great\nlittle man.\n\nGLEN, 50's, hairpiece and jowls, steps up.\n\nGLEN\nI got my daughter a Boxster for her\nSweet 16. Made me take it back.\nSaid it was “too girly.”\n\nThey all laugh again. Nick grits his teeth.\n\nNICK\nOkay. Maybe we should get to work.\n\fARTHUR\nYou couldn't at least spring for\nthe Carrera?\n\nNICK\nFigured I’d go with the classic.\n\nPETER\nUh, the Boxster was introduced\nabout forty years after the\nCarrera. So, not exactly “a\nclassic.”\n\nJEANINE\n(patting him on the\nshoulder)\nDon’t worry, Nick. Another ten\nyears here, you'll be able to\nafford a real car.\n\nNick stares at her.\n\nARTHUR\nAll right, guys. Looks like the\nSwiss are about to change their\ndrawdown regs, so we need to talk\nabout a new home for our master\nfeeder fund.\n\nThe presidents turn back to the piles of paperwork on the\ntable in front of them and resume their dreary work. As they\ntalk, the sound drops down and we PUSH IN on Nick as he\nstares at his colleagues.\n\nNICK (V.O.)\n\nYou know what’s at the top of the\ncorporate ladder? Another goddamn\nladder. I may be a president, but\nI'm really just a fucking corporate\ntool.\n\nFREEZE ON Nick’s forlorn expression as the words appear over\nhim:\n\nFUCKING\n\nCORPORATE\n\nTOOL\n\nEXT.",

Sitting on\nthe couch is RHONDA HARKEN and her friends, NIKKI, late 30's,\na lot of work done, and HEIDI, early 40’s, even more work.\n\nKURT (V.O.)\n\nDoes it bother me that my sugar\nmama happens to be the ex-wife of\nthe man who tried to kill me and my\nfriends?

Because\nthis is gross. Here, touch it.\n\nAs the other women begin to poke and prod Kurt’s abdomen, he\nsighs heavily.\n\nKURT (V.O.)\nI guess the only real downside of\nthis whole arrangement is that\nsometimes I feel kinda, I don’t\nknow, bad about myself.

DALE’S HOUSE - DAY\n\nDALE ARBUS opens the front door of his tiny house. His VERY\npregnant wife, STACY, bids him goodbye. Dale leans in to\nkiss her, but her enormous belly makes it hard to reach her\nface.\n\nDALE (V.O.)\nIt’s all happening. I got married.\nStacy’s pregnant-- with triplets!\nAnd I finally got my sex offender\nstatus expunged. Which is great,\nbecause otherwise I’d have to stay\n100 yards from my own kids.\n\nDale crosses to his car and pulls out of the driveway.\n\fEXT. DR.

WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nDale enters a world of CHAOS populated by screaming KIDS and\na handful of exhausted PARENTS. Toys lie strewn everywhere.\nA group of TODDLERS tear the upholstery out of a sofa\ncushion. A RECEPTIONIST sits at a desk, oblivious.\n\nDale takes a step and TRIPS over something off-camera. He\nlooks down and picks up the CRYING INFANT he stumbled on.\n\nDALE\nOkay, whose baby is this? You\ncan’t just leave your babies on the\nfloor.\n\nA harried MOTHER takes the baby from him as he carefully\npicks his way across the kid-covered floor.\n\nINT. EXAMINATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n\nDale enters to find a 4 YEAR-OLD BOY, GABE, hollering\nmiserably as DR. SLOCUM, 80’s, sits slumped asleep with\n\ndental tools still inside Gabe’s open mouth.\n\nDALE\nNot again.\n\nDale hurries over and nudges the dentist awake.\n\fDALE (CONT'D)\nDr. Slocum! Wake up.
