ZIRA\nherself begins to nod into a doze; then (with a start)\nrealizes that she must not sleep exposed, but only in\nconcealment. She rises with BABY and enters:\n\nINT. CABIN\n\nPretty dark, for the sunlight barely filters through the\ntwo filthy scupper panes. And you wouldn't know it was\na cabin, because all the furniture has long since been\nremoved. She adjusts the blanket so that it will serve\nboth as a wrap and a pillow for the BABY; then herself\nlies down on the bare boards (from which a cockroach\nscuttles) with her head near the BABY.
