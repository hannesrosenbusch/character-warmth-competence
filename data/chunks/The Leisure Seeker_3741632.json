The only people passing by at\nthis time of day are a group of elderly power-walkers,\nswinging tiny weights.\n\nThe pick-up stops in front of a lawn that is badly in need of\na trim. The radio cuts off and WILL emerges. He’s forty-five;\naverage-looking. He pulls a shoulder bag and then two stuffed\nWhole Foods shopping bags from the passenger seat. When he\nkicks the truck’s door shut we see a sign: “SECOND HAND -\nVINTAGE SHOPPING ONLINE www.secondhand.com”\n\nINT./EXT. ELLA’S AND JOHN’S HOUSE - DAY 2\n\nWill enters through the kitchen door without knocking. He\nputs down the bags and announces his presence with forced\ngood cheer:\n\nWILL\nMom? It’s me! You ready? Jane’ll be\nhere any minute. I made a cake for\nDad, hazelnut and carrot. No butter\nor sugar, so you can have a slice!\n\nNo answer. Will starts to explore various rooms.\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\nWhere are you guys?\n\nIt’s a cozy, slightly messy house. There’s a living room with\na fireplace, a big library. Will collects an open book and\nshelves it, then folds a shirt that’s been tossed on a chair.\n\nHe opens the door to the master bedroom. The bed is unmade.\nHis father John’s study.

He scratches his head. An elderly\nlady in gardening attire stands in the yard next door. It’s\nLILLIAN, the neighbor. She’s gray-haired, friendly:\n\nLILLIAN\nWill! How are you?\n\nWILL\n(approaches her)\nHey, Lillian.\n\nLILLIAN\n(whispers)\nI’m glad I caught you alone.

Dad's car’s right here.\n\nHe points to a perfectly-maintained old Chevy in the open\ngarage. And then he realizes the large covered carport is\nopen.\n\nWILL (CONT'D)\nOh my god!\n\nHe’s white as a ghost. He runs toward the carport. Lillian’s\nalso shocked. She murmurs:\n\fScene 2 Page 3.\n\nLILLIAN\nI can’t believe this.\n\nWill frantically dials and impatiently awaits an answer:\n\nWILL\nJane! Mom and Dad are gone!

STUCKEY’S - DAY 5\n\nThe Leisure Seeker cuts across oncoming traffic, causing cars\nto swerve and horns to sound. It pulls up to a gas pump.\n\nTwo attendants approach. They are both Middle Eastern in\nappearance; around thirty years old. They act like a married\ncouple. The FEMALE ATTENDANT washes windows while the MALE\nATTENDANT starts to pump gas.
