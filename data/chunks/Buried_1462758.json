UNKNOWN ROOM - NIGHT\n\n\n\n          Darkness. Silence. After a long beat, we hear movement,\n\n          confined and contained.\n\n          We then hear the sound of a man, PAUL CONROY, groaning,\n\n          making confused attempts at words. We hear his movement;\n\n          short, abrupt shifting, ending almost immediately with the\n\n          sound of his body banging against wood.\n\n          He screams, though it's clear from the sound that his mouth\n\n          is covered by something.\n\n          After attempting to sit up, he immediately bangs his head\n\n          against something. It's terribly warm and his breaths are\n\n          labored.\n\n          He attempts to move to his left and right, only to find that\n\n          he is confined on those sides, as well. He frantically\n\n          shifts about, only to discover, by touch, that he is encased\n\n          in something.\n\n          Something is very wrong, and he doesn't need to see to know\n\n          that.\n\n          Finally, we see him, lit by the flame of the Zippo he holds\n\n          in his hands, which are bound together in front of him with\n\n          rope. A rolled-up, dirty rag is tied tightly around his\n\n          head, stretched across his mouth. Dried blood stains his\n\n          hair and forehead.\n\n\n\n                         \n\n          We see that he is lying in an old fashioned, wooden coffin.\n\n          Nothing more than a few rotted-out planks of wood nailed\n\n          together. Realizing the same, Paul is struck by an\n\n          overwhelming, instant panic.\n\n          With great difficulty, and while still holding the lit Zippo,\n\n          Paul removes the muzzle from his mouth.\n\n\n\n                          PAUL\n\n           What...? What is this?\n\n          His words become almost unintelligible as he flails about,\n\n          though fear is understood in his every utterance.\n\n          He screams aloud, but his voice is captured by the coffin\n\n          walls.\n\n\n\n           2.\n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n                          PAUL\n\n           Oh my God!

He kicks and slams his hands against the top and sides of the\n\n          coffin, all to no avail. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n His violent movements cause small\n\n          grains of sand to trickle in through the space between the\n\n          sides and top of the coffin, as well as a small gap that\n\n          exists between one of the coffin's broken wooden planks.\n\n          Sweat cascades down the side of his neck, dripping from his\n\n          dampened brow. The heat inside the extremely close confines\n\n          of the coffin is stifling.\n\n\n\n                          PAUL (CONT'D)\n\n           Somebody help me! Please!!\n\n          Paul continues with his futile efforts to pry off the top of\n\n          the coffin. The sides, the top, the bottom -- all are too\n\n          thoroughly reinforced by the force of what surrounds the\n\n          coffin. Sand. It becomes clear to him that he is buried.\n\n          He tries his best to calm himself, though he has trouble\n\n          catching his breath. It takes him some time, but he\n\n          eventually achieves some semblance of calm.\n\n          Getting a good look at him for the first time, we see that\n\n          Paul is somewhere around 37 years old. Unshaven and\n\n          physically unremarkable, he embodies the blue-collar American\n\n          everyman.\n\n          He coughs. The minimal amount of oxygen in the coffin makes\n\n          it hard for him to breathe.\n\n          His eyes widen a bit upon seeing an exposed, rusty nail. He\n\n          tries desperately to use the nail to cut through the old,\n\n          frayed ropes that bind his hands. Doing so is no easy task.\n\n          The incredibly tight quarters makes his every action nearly\n\n          impossible.\n\n          After a lengthy struggle, the rope snaps. Paul quickly frees\n\n          his hands. A small victory. Very small.\n\n          The heat is unbearable. Paul takes off his button-down\n\n          shirt, leaving him in a T-shirt. His body battles against\n\n          the walls and the ceiling of the coffin with every move he\n\n          makes.\n\n          He tosses his button-down shirt down by his feet. His\n\n          undershirt is drenched through with sweat.\n\n          Still trying to calm himself, but having little success in\n\n          doing so, Paul looks around the coffin. His feet, though\n\n          only his body-length away, seem miles from him.\n\n\n\n           3.\n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n                         \n\n          He looks at the top of the coffin, and then back at his feet.",

He looks at the top of the coffin, and then back at his feet. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n          With great difficulty, he shifts his body so that his feet\n\n          are pressed against the top of the coffin. He attempts to\n\n          use his leg strength to push the top off of him, but it\n\n          doesn't move even a millimeter.\n\n          After several failed attempts, and with his legs exhausted,\n\n          Paul drops his feet from the top of the coffin. He lay for a\n\n          moment in silence, followed by an outburst of crying.\n\n          Close to his head, on the corner of the floor, we see there's\n\n          another broken plank. A small hole.\n\n          He closes his cigarette lighter, extinguishing the flame. In\n\n          total darkness, he continues to cry.\n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n                          PAUL (CONT'D)\n\n           What is this?\n\n          With his sobbing slowly subsiding, the coffin soon grows\n\n          eerily silent.\n\n          The sound of Paul's labored breaths are all we hear, softened\n\n          under the blanket of absolute darkness.\n\n          After a beat, the silence is interrupted by a subtle buzzing\n\n          sound. The muted sight of strange, blueish light flickers in\n\n          the coffin, by Paul's feet. He is extremely startled.\n\n          The buzzing continues, as does the minimal splashing of\n\n          light. It's coming from underneath his discarded button-down\n\n          shirt, down near his feet.\n\n          He lights the Zippo to get a better look.\n\n\n\n                         \n\n          Pulling the shirt away, he realizes that what he is hearing\n\n          and seeing is the vibrating ring and display features of an\n\n          older model cell phone.\n\n          He frantically reaches for it, though the coffin is far too\n\n          small for him to reposition himself so easily.\n\n          To his dismay, the phone stops ringing. But, his efforts to\n\n          reach it continue. He uses his feet to search for the phone.\n\n          After some trouble finding it, he eventually locates it.\n\n          Clamping the phone together between his clasped feet, Paul\n\n          then painfully angles his body so that he can reach his feet\n\n          with his hands and grab it.\n\n          He is soon able to reach it. Immediately thereafter, he\n\n          flips open the phone and puts the receiver in front of him.\n\n\n\n           4.\n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n                         \n\n          We see that there is a Text Message waiting for Paul on the\n\n          phone.

However, Paul barely notices. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n          The time on the phone reads 6:12pm. While the numbers and\n\n          display screen icons are familiar to Americans, all the words\n\n          are in Arabic.\n\n          What he does notices is that the phone barely has one bar of\n\n          signal strength. Worse yet, there is only half of the\n\n          battery life remaining.\n\n          He tries to remember the Safe Number he was given. With the\n\n          phone open and ready to be dialed, Paul struggles to recall\n\n          the information.\n\n\n\n                          PAUL (CONT'D)\n\n           Come on, come on.

He hastily removes a prescription pill bottle and\n\n          a small, metal flask. Both are not what he was looking for.\n\n          He then reaches to his back pocket and removes his wallet.\n\n          It's empty. His license, his credit cards, his cash and,\n\n          most importantly at that very moment, a piece of paper with\n\n          the Safe Number written on it, are all missing.\n\n\n\n                          PAUL (CONT'D)\n\n           No. Where the hell is it?

And further.\n\n          Carefully. Moving a millimeter at a time. He shifts the\n\n          position of his head slightly, charily, to see next to his\n\n          feet.\n\n          He leans in even closer with the glow stick. But then --\n\n          -- his wary movement comes to immediate stop.\n\n          It's a snake. A two-foot, saw-scaled viper. It has\n\n          positioned itself in the corner of the coffin, inches from\n\n          Paul's feet.\n\n\n\n           54.\n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n                         \n\n          His terror evident, Paul very slowly pulls his feet back\n\n          toward his upper body, away from the snake.

The snake hisses, poised to strike\n\n          at any moment. Paul raises his foot. Steels himself.\n\n          Prepares to preempt the snake with a solid stomp.\n\n          A more sensible plan soon prevails. After lowering his foot,\n\n          Paul cautiously removes the flask from his pocket. Slowly\n\n          unscrews the top. Splashes a small amount of alcohol on the\n\n          floor, close to the snake.\n\n          The snake recoils slightly, but then menacingly twists itself\n\n          into a new posture, ready to attack. Paul lowers the Zippo\n\n          to the small puddle of alcohol. After a few sparks --\n\n\n\n                         \n\n          -- it lights. A flash-fire.

While turning, however, he inadvertently kicks\n\n          the Zippo from the side of the coffin -- landing it on the\n\n          floor, up against the glow stick -- and knocks over the\n\n          flask.\n\n          We see that the flame of the Zippo slowly melts the plastic\n\n          glow stick, causing it to dim slightly.\n\n          Worst still, and completely unbeknownst to Paul, a stream of\n\n          alcohol slowly makes its way from the flask and toward the\n\n          flame of the lighter, threatening to set the coffin ablaze.\n\n          Inch by inch, the flammable spirit gets closer.\n\n          Still in the midst of his repositioning, Paul looks back and\n\n          sees the alcohol nearing the flame. In a panic, he attempts\n\n          to reach and grab the Zippo. But, he finds himself stuck in\n\n          the middle of the coffin.

His odd positioning makes reaching his\n\n          foot almost impossible. He struggles to undo the laces and\n\n          remove it from his foot.\n\n          With his face beet red from the force of his strain, Paul\n\n          finally removes his shoe.

The sound barely\n\n          makes its way through the hundreds of pounds of sand that\n\n          envelop the coffin.\n\n          A sign of hope, as well as a point of reference for his\n\n          location -- albeit a very vague one.\n\n          He listens further as the call to prayer continues. The\n\n          light of the glow stick dims further.\n\n          Paul then opens his phone. Sees that he missed Jabir's call.\n\n          He starts to call Jabir back, but stops. He instead\n\n          navigates through the various display menus. He soon reaches\n\n          what appears to be the Tools Menu, though it's difficult to\n\n          tell because everything is written in Arabic. He becomes\n\n          frustrated as he fails to find what he is looking for.\n\n          On the verge of mental surrender, he sees something that\n\n          gives him pause.

But, because it was partially\n\n          melted to the floor, the stick snaps in two.

The vibration becomes so intense that it\n\n          violently shakes Paul around the coffin.\n\n          The sound of jet plane engines are heard coming from above,\n\n          flying by as the massive explosions continue.\n\n          Sand seeps in through the crack between the top and sides of\n\n          the coffin as it shakes.

He grunts and\n\n          screams loudly, using what little strength he has left to\n\n          keep the top from caving.\n\n          The shaking soon stops, though the steady flow of sand\n\n          continues.\n\n\n\n           64.\n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n                         \n\n          In efforts to prevent the sand from filling the coffin any\n\n          faster, Paul removes the button-down shirt from the hole and\n\n          stuffs into the area where it enters with the greatest\n\n          volume. He removes the balled-up cloth from the other hole\n\n          and does the same with it. Both offer very little help.\n\n          The flashlight falls to the floor.

The vibration grows louder and\n\n          louder in his mind, sounding more and more like the sound of\n\n          rotating helicopter blades.\n\n          He then hears what sounds like VOICES, yelling from on top of\n\n          the coffin.\n\n\n\n                          VOICE #1\n\n           He's down here!\n\n\n\n                          VOICE #2\n\n           Get him out!

Shovels,\n\n          digging deep into the ground, are heard banging against the\n\n          top of the coffin.\n\n          The top of the coffin is torn open, sending a brilliant ray\n\n          of white light onto Paul. He stares into the light, crying,\n\n          eking out a tortured smile.\n\n\n\n           82.\n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n                         \n\n          Suddenly, Paul is back in the same predicament. The voices,\n\n          the shovels, the light -- it was all a hallucination, brought\n\n          upon by his loss of blood.\n\n          He's still alone. He's still in the coffin, which continues\n\n          to fill up with sand. He is too exhausted to display his\n\n          disappointment.\n\n          The phone continues to vibrate. It soon stops. Paul is in\n\n          too poor condition to show any concern.\n\n          After a beat, the phone begins vibrating once again. After\n\n          several rings, Paul languidly picks it up. He barely\n\n          recognizes the number through his extremely blurred vision.\n\n          He's so weak, he's barely able to formulate words. He spits\n\n          out stray particles of sand from his mouth.\n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n                          PAUL\n\n           Yeah?\n\n\n\n                          DAN\n\n           Paul, it's Brenner.\n\n          Paul doesn't have the strength to answer.\n\n\n\n                          DAN (CONT'D)\n\n           Paul?
