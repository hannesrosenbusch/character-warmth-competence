Youth Talent Night 2007.”\n\nLamb takes this performance very seriously, even if it’s just\nfor friends and family. She holds the mic like a pro, fanning\nher fingers and using moves she’s learned from TV. She smiles\nand begins to sing in an unsteady, nervous voice.\n\nThe song is “Place in This World,” a Christian anthem by\nMichael W. Smith.\n\nLAMB (2007)\nThe wind is moving\nBut I am standing still\nA life of pages\nWaiting to be filled\n\nINT.
