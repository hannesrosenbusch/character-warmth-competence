BBC RADIO NEWSROOM - LATE MORNING\n\n\n\n               We are IN CLOSE as a story arrives on a press service \n\n               teleprinter.  A Hand tears away the sheet.  The CAMERA \n\n               TRACKS as we follow the story.  It passes through the \n\n               copytaster's hands and it passes on down to the summaries \n\n               desk.\n\n\n\n               This is a time of steady activity.  Journalists move about \n\n               the room to consult.  Others are writing in longhand, and \n\n               several are dictating copy to typists, who are all women.  \n\n               One or two people - NEWSREADERS - sit about doing nothing.  \n\n               Much movement of paper.\n\n\n\n               Over the sound of typewriters and the murmur of dictating \n\n               voices we HEAR a WOMAN'S VOICE over the P.A. Announce, \n\n               \"The Leader of the Opposition on five\".  A few journalists \n\n               pick up their headsets, but they do not stop writing.  We \n\n               establish the atmosphere - laconic but efficient, and a \n\n               little down-at-heel.\n\n\n\n               At the summaries desk we find JAMES PENFIELD.  He stands \n\n               to the side of a little behind a seated secretary, dictating \n\n               in a laconic deadpan voice from a sheet of scrawled \n\n               longhand.\n\n\n\n                                     JAMES\n\n                         Between fifty and sixty scrap metal \n\n                         workers are..\n\n\n\n               The phone rings.

The newsreader settles himself \n\n               behind the microphone.  James sits back, professionally \n\n               bored, rolling a stub of a pencil between his fingers.\n\n\n\n               Through a large loudspeaker we hear a Radio 4 programme \n\n               winding up.  Theme music.\n\n\n\n               The newsreader has a plummy authoritative voice and is a \n\n               year or two younger than James.

I could \n\n                         see there were two paths I could \n\n                         go down, power or not-power.

Down the other path, \n\n                         I could keep on working.

Jeremy and James keep up their \n\n               friendship with Edward because they recognise his talent, \n\n               and this makes them feel more authentic.  Edward keeps up \n\n               with them because he is lonely and his own life is rather \n\n               dull.  However, he does distrust them a little.

This continues through the \n\n               scene.  They hunch up and turn away from each other, shaking \n\n               quietly, half recover, become aware of each other, or of \n\n               the absurdity of the questions, or of Edward's attempts to \n\n               deal with them, and they fold up once more.

I \n\n                         get ideas in much the same way as \n\n                         anyone does.  Perhaps the difference \n\n                         is that I take them more seriously.  \n\n                         I write them down - odd scraps of \n\n                         things.  Then I seem to know when \n\n                         I'm ready to start work on a poem.  \n\n                         It takes shape to start work on a \n\n                         poem.

JAMES'S FLAT - NIGHT\n\n\n\n               Susan sits cross-legged in the centre of James's bed.  \n\n               James lies along one edge, head propped on elbows.  They've \n\n               been drinking coffee.  We have the sense of a long evening \n\n               of talk, but not much else so far.  A pause before Susan \n\n               speaks.\n\n\n\n                                     JAMES\n\n                         Why not stay?\n\n\n\n                                     SUSAN\n\n                         I have to be up early.\n\n                              (She stands)\n\n\n\n                                     JAMES\n\n                         Me too.\n\n\n\n                                     SUSAN\n\n                              (straightening \n\n                              herself at the \n\n                              mirror.

NEWSROOM - EARLY MORNING\n\n\n\n               A day or two later.  People are drifting out to go down \n\n               the corridor to the morning news conference.  James is one \n\n               of the last to leave.  On his way out he meets Charles, \n\n               the newsreader from Scene two.\n\n\n\n                                     JAMES\n\n                         Charles!

Yes, that's right.  \n\n                         He said he's got to go away for a \n\n                         while, and that he'll be writing \n\n                         to you and please don't try and \n\n                         contact him ...
