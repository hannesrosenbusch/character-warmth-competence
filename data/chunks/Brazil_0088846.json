The\n\tCAMERA starts to move downwards. A large neon sign rises\n\tinto shot. It rests on top of a skyscraper and fills the\n\tframe. The building is neither past nor future in design\n\tbut a bit of both.\n\t\n\tSlowly we pan downwards revealing the city that spreads\n\tbelow ... A glittering conglomeration of elevated\n\ttransport tubes, smaller square buildings which are merely\n\thuge, with, here and there, the comparatively minuscule\n\trelics of previous ages of architecture, pavement level\n\tawnings suggesting restaurants and shops ... Transparent\n\ttubes carry whizzing transport cages past us ... an\n\televated highway carrying traffic composed primarily of\n\tlarge transport lorries passes thru frame. As we descend,\n\tthe sunlight is blocked out and street lights & neon signs\n\ttake over as illumination. Eventually we reach the upper\n\tlevels of a plush shopping precinct.\n\n2   INT.   SHOPPING PRECINT\t\t\t   NIGHT\t\t  2\n\t\n\tXmas decorations are everywhere. PEOPLE are busy buying,\n\togling, discussing, choosing wisely from the goodies on\n\tdisplay. SHOPPERS are going by laden with superbly\n\tpackaged goods ... the shop windows are full of\n\telaborately boxed and be-ribboned who-knows-what. In one\n\twindow is a bank of TV sets - on the great majority of the\n\tscreens is the face of MR. HELPMANN - the Deputy Minister\n\tof Information. He is being interviewed. No-one bothers to\n\tlisten to HELPMANN.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t INTERVIEWER\n\t\t\tDeputy minister, what do you believe\n\t\t\tis behind this recent increase in\n\t\t\tterrorist bombings?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  HELPMANN\n\t\t\tBad sportsmanship.

It looks like a\n\tmassive medieval fortress gone to sea. The screen is\n\tengulfed in stone. The CAMERA heads up the side of the\n\tship. Higher and higher we climb - past course after\n\tcourse of mammoth stones. Reaching the first deck, we\n\tcontinue upwards. There appears to be no entrance. SAM is\n\tlooking frustrated and angry. But then he spots an\n\topening. A few stones have come loose - one of them juts\n\tout forming a ledge. As the cage passes, SAM jumps and\n\tmanaged to gain a foothold on the outcropping. Squeezing\n\tthru the gap in the rocks, he makes his way thru a dark\n\tpassage. Emerging from the opening he finds himself\n\tteetering over an enormous abyss formed by the outer hull\n\tand the inner stone core of the ship. Great stone ribs\n\tcurve downwards thru the darkness broken only by narrow\n\tshafts of brilliant light streaming from occasional cracks\n\tand fissures in the stone core. For a brief moment SAM\n\tgets a glimpse of blue sky thru one of the openings but\n\this attention is distracted by a distant moan. Huddled far\n\tbelow him at the bottom of the dark abyss are hundreds of\n\tgrey shrouded PRISONERS. Their moan blends with the creaks\n\tand groans of the stones as the ship slowly wallows back\n\tand forth. Suddenly a great boom resounds throughout the\n\tship. SAM is unsure where it comes from. And then another\n\tboom reverberates about him. He has to steady himself as\n\tthe ship quivers from the noise. Another book. He clutches\n\tat the wall.\n\t\n\t\n66  INT.
