OZIM (a plump middle-aged Turk)\n\n    is cutting the hair of the last customer of the day (SOYKA).\n\n    Soyka is a Chechen, well-groomed, wearing a sharp suit\n\n    beneath the barber's gown.\n\n\n\n    During the conversation we glimpse distinctive eagle- and\n\n    star-shaped tattoos on Soyka's arms and hands.\n\n\n\n    Ozim and Soyka are chatting as Ekrem enters.
