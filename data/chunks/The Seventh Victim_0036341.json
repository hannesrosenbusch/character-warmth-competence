As she passes it, it rings the hour. She looks at\n\n               its friendly, familiar face, and gives it a little pat of\n\n               farewell.

Along one wall is a crudely\n\n               painted mural, a reproduction of the famous painting which\n\n               shows Dante's first meeting with Beatrice. Dante is passing\n\n               along the cobbled street, and Beatrice, with two companions,\n\n               large, flourishing wenches, is casting him a coy look over\n\n               her shoulder in passing. Directly under the feet of the poet\n\n               is a small table for one patron. On a back counter stands an\n\n               enormous, shining metal coffee machine. This is a patented\n\n               contraption for making coffee. The entire machine is\n\n               contrived to serve only one small purpose to make a cup of\n\n               coffee by driving steam through ground coffee. Near this\n\n               machine and flanking the door into the kitchen are fake palms\n\n               in wooden tubs. There is a door leading to the house hallway,\n\n               and through this door we can see the newel post of the\n\n               stairway leading to the rooms above. On most of the tables,\n\n               platters of antipasto have been arranged in readiness for the\n\n               dinner hour. When Mary enters, the restaurant is empty, but\n\n               echoes to the sound of a rich female voice singing with great\n\n               sentimental emphasis the words of \"Care Mio Ben.\" Mary looks\n\n               around, hesitates a moment, and then starts toward the back\n\n               of the restaurant, as if following the source of the singing.\n\n               At the swinging door which separates the restaurant from the\n\n               kitchen Mary hesitates a moment, then knocks timidly. The\n\n               singing continues, and realizing that her knock will not be\n\n               heard above it, Mary shyly pushes open the door.\n\n\n\n               INT. KITCHEN - DANTE RESTAURANT - DAY\n\n\n\n               This is a cluttered, busy, steaming kitchen. In one corner at\n\n               a little table Mr. Romari, the proprietor, in a waiter's\n\n               uniform, is busily folding napkins. Mrs. Romari herself from\n\n               whose bosom come the sounds of\n\n\n\n               \"Caro Mio Ben,\" can be seen through a cloud of steam behind a\n\n               boiling, kettle of spaghetti.",

The furniture is Grand Rapids Sheraton and the\n\n               pictures on the wall are representative of hotel art at its\n\n               worst, colored prints showing French canals, poplar trees and\n\n               old towers. An incongruous picture, however, a huge chrome in\n\n               an ornate fretwork frame dominates one wall. This is the\n\n               famous picture of the guardian angel which shows a little\n\n               child, gowned in white, who is about to fall over a precipice\n\n               wore it not for the benign hand of her guardian angel, a\n\n               figure complete with white robe and white wings. Under this\n\n               picture is a bureau. It has been converted to a writer's\n\n               needs by the simple expedient of removing one drawer and\n\n               reinserting it so that the bottom of the drawer can be used\n\n               as a base for a typewriter. On this overturned drawer stand a\n\n               portable typewriter, a box full of paper, some loose\n\n               manuscript and a marmalade jar full of pencils. Between a\n\n               pair of bookends are about four volumes with the author's\n\n               name  Louis Judd  plainly evident on the dust jackets. They\n\n               are the only books in the room. At the end of the room is a\n\n               small, useless sort of desk. This has been made into a\n\n               dressing table by putting a fitted toilet case on top and\n\n               opening it.

They stand\n\n               beside the sofa near Mrs. Redi. Mrs. Redi pours another cup\n\n               of tea. Mrs. Cortez poises the cream pitcher over it. She\n\n               turns to a tall dark-haired woman who is standing near the\n\n               window.\n\n\n\n                                   MRS.

She seats herself in\n\n               a small chair facing the sofa. Mrs. Redi starts to pour\n\n               another cup of tea, but has a slight mishap. There is a\n\n               clatter.\n\n\n\n                                   MRS.

Behind it the night sky can be seen, and\n\n               occasionally the beam of a searchlight cuts across. There is\n\n               a bed, an easy chair and a desk with a typewriter stand\n\n               beside it. The walls of the room are almost hidden by\n\n               bookcases and books, and even the mantel bears a burden of\n\n               numerous volumes. Jason is seated at his desk, turned toward\n\n               the typewriter. He types a line, reads it inaudibly and at\n\n               the same time beats out the rhythm with his left hand on the\n\n               desk top. Evidently it scans, because he types another line\n\n               and is about to repeat the rhythmic test on it, when there is\n\n               a small knock on the door. He gets up, crosses the room and\n\n               opens the door. Mary stands outside.

Somewhat relieved, she walks a\n\n               little bit more confidently. Suddenly, there is a clatter and\n\n               bang of metal behind her.

She hesitates then starts to\n\n               cross the street diagonally, looking back all the while at\n\n               the doorway. From the center of the street it can be seen\n\n               that a man stands there. With him stands a woman, her figure\n\n               somewhat lost in the doorway. They are saying good night. On\n\n               the opposite side of the street, Jacqueline hurries toward\n\n               the Avenue.\n\n\n\n               EXT.

Again she starts on and from the shadow of a light\n\n               standard a deeper shadow detaches itself and steps out behind\n\n               her. It is Leo and he is grinning. She sees him and begins to\n\n               run down the cross street. She runs wildly. Leo, at first\n\n               lengthens his stride, and then suddenly breaks into a lope -\n\n               a lope that will bring him up to her within an instant.\n\n\n\n               She ducks into an alley and is lost in the darkness. She\n\n               hides in a corner amid some debris, crouching back out of the\n\n               light. Leo plunges ahead in pursuit. Jacqueline stands a\n\n               moment as the sound of his footsteps diminish, then turns\n\n               back and begins running down the street. Ahead of her, a dark\n\n               slim figure, not unlike Leo's, is walking up the street\n\n               toward her.\n\n\n\n               She dodges into the next alley. This is an alley behind a\n\n               theatre. It is cluttered with all sorts of strange\n\n               impedimenta; flats, crates, etc. There is an overhead lamp\n\n               burning in the center of the alley, but the periphery of the\n\n               light beneath it, does not extend to the walls of the alley.\n\n               The area immediately adjacent to these walls is heavy with\n\n               darkness and strange shadows. Jacqueline stands in the middle\n\n               of the pool of light and listens. It seems to her that she\n\n               can hear in the darkness the soft tap-tap of someone walking\n\n               on his toes. She shrinks back from the bright light into the\n\n               darkness and begins to grope her way along the wall, She is\n\n               going from left to right. A sound at her right attracts her\n\n               attention and she looks off, but continues to grope her way\n\n               along the wall to the left.",

She screams and then silently struggles to free\n\n               herself. Still smiling he holds her firmly with his right\n\n               band. With his left hand he draws something from his pocket.\n\n               He presses a button on this and a four-and a-half inch knife\n\n               blade flashes out. Jacqueline stands stock still with fright.\n\n               Leo's hand goes back for the blow.\n\n\n\n               At the opposite side of the alley a door is suddenly thrown\n\n               wide open and a great patch of light is thrown on Jacqueline\n\n               and Leo. He puts the knife behind his back.\n\n\n\n               Out of the door come half a dozen people in costumes. They\n\n               are members of a ballet company performing in the theatre.\n\n               Also there emerges the sound of loud and merry music.\n\n\n\n               The actors are in a gay mood laughing and shouting.

Jacqueline breaks from Leo's hand-hold on her\n\n               wrist and runs in among them.\n\n\n\n               One of the dancers is an enormous man dressed in Roman half\n\n               armor to represent the god Gambrinus, with gilded hop blooms\n\n               as a garland about his shoulders and wearing a papier mache\n\n               mask, surmounted by crown of similarly gilded hop leaves and\n\n               wheat. The face of the mask is a grinning, jolly, rubicund\n\n               visage.  It is next to this enormous man that Jacqueline\n\n               finds herself. In sportive mood the giant dancer sweeps her\n\n               up with one arm, forcing her to dance his grotesque steps.\n\n\n\n                                   JACQUELINE\n\n                         Please.
