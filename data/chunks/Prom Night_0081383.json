His makeup has been slop-\n\n          pily applied. The rouged cheeks and the smudged red\n\n          lips amplify the grotesque impersonation.\n\n          Kim strokes her brother's hair. Hammond presses his\n\n          hysterical wife to him. The onlookers slowly close in.\n\n          We SLOWLY DISSOLVE FROM Alex's face TO a photograph of\n\n          the Hammond family taken seven years earlier. We MOVE\n\n          IN CLOSE ON the twins. Alex and Robin are smiling.\n\n\n\n          FADE OUT.\n\n\n\n                         THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
