She sits on the\n\nbed and begins to unceremoniously undress. When her blouse\n\ncomes off, we see needle tracks and bruises on her arms.\n\nShe pulls a comb from her purse and listlessly combs her\n\nlank hair. She drops the hand holding the comb and begins\n\nto nod. Arctor looks at the tracks, at the pimple on her\n\ncheek.

He opens his eyes, groggily orients himself,\n\nglances over at the woman next to him. It's Donna. He\n\nbolts upright, studies her face. It's still Donna. He\n\nfumbles for the switch on the night table lamp and knocks it\n\nto the floor. The woman next to him sleeps on. He watches\n\nher face. Gradually it begins to turn back into Connie.\n\nArctor drops onto his back and looks at the ceiling.\n\n\n\nINT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY\n\n\n\nFred sits in his cubicle monitoring the scanners.

He stands in Arctor's bedroom\n\nfor a while, confused and disoriented, tries to look at\n\nhimself in Arctor's bureau mirror. Fred does not appear in\n\nthe holographic reflection of the room. He shudders,\n\nreturns to the console, brings up all eight monitors, and\n\nturns off the freeze-frame.

For a week he saw it\n\n             wherever he looked. Always the same\n\n             proportions, very narrow. Very\n\n             pleasing.

Later when he couldn't see\n\n             it anymore, he became so frustrated\n\n             with the noise and lights and motion\n\n             in this world.
