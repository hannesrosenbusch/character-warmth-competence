World War 2 is over.\n\nCU A Danish soldier, Carl (41)(military rank: Sergeant) is\ndriving along in a jeep. He turns into a gravel road.\nAfter a while he comes to the dunes overlooking the beach.\nCarl parks the jeep and steps out. He walks over the\ndunes. On his back is a big backpack from which little\nblack flags are sticking out. Carl stops on top of one\nof the dunes and looks across the beach. Clearly, this is\na post-war landscape. As far the eye can see the beach\n\nis covered with lines of barbwire and signs saying.\n‘DANGER! MINES.'\n\nCarl pushes some sand off with his foot. (He looks at a\nmine map) A wooden plank (Pansermine) appears beneath the\nsand. Carl puts his backpack down and digs further up\nahead. Another plank appears. Carl puts his backpack\nback on and walks along the planks down towards the sea.\nHe treads carefully, it is obvious that the entire beach\nis littered with mines. You can even see some of them\npoke up through the sand.\n\nCarl goes all the way to the water before he stops. He\nlooks down the beach. He pulls a flag out of his backpack\nand sticks it into the sand. Then we walks along the\nwater.\n\nINT. ARMY TRUCK - AFTERNOON\n\nCU of young German soldier on the back of an army truck.\nThis is Sebastian(16).\n\nBesides Sebastian are 11 other German boys.\n\nWe see their faces one by one. Manfred(16), Werner(17),\nErnst(17), Helmut(19), Ludvig(16), Wilhelm(15) and so on.\n12 boys in all. They are just teenagers, nevertheless\ntheir youngish faces have a worn-out look to them. Like\nthey have borrowed them from much older, and more\nexperienced men. Hard and weary. The boys all look like\nthey have been starving, some more than others. They are\nin various types of uniform. All of which are worn and\ntorn.",

Hidden from the view of\nthe others, they are holding hands.\n\nSebastian peers out through the a gap in tarpaulin cloth\nthat covers the back of the truck. He squints as the\nsetting sun gets in his eyes. The truck is driving along\na straight road through a forest near the Danish North\nSea coastline.\n\fEXT. COUNTRY ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON\n\nCarl is driving his jeep along. He drives past long lines\nof German prisoners of war walking south along the road,\nheading back down towards Germany.\n\nFurther ahead there is a scuffle between some Danes and\nthe German POV's. Carl pulls up to them. Honks the horn.\nHe stops and gets out.\n\nCarl drags the Danes away. The Germans are about to\ncontinue walking. Carl turns towards them.\n\nCARL (in German)\nYou stay here. Understood?\n\nThe Germans wait.\n\nCarl goes over and talks to the Danes. (From afar) We\ncan't hear what they are saying.

The German takes one and smiles back.\nCarl takes out a lighter.\n\nLong beat.\n\nCarl headbutts the German. He goes down. Carl looks at\nthe other Germans. They make no move to interfere. They\nlook scared.\n\nNobody speaks.\n\nThe German who was knocked down by Carl gets back up.\nThey start walking.\n\nEXT. ARMY BARRACKS S@NDERBORG AREA - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n \n\nThe truck with Sebastian and the boys drives through a\ngate. It stops on a large open square. We see several\ntrucks pull up next to it. Pebbles crunch under the heavy\ntruck tires.\n\nGerman prisoners of war in all ages spill out from the\ntrucks and settle in the square. A few Danish armed\nsoldiers are there to receive them.\n\nEXT.
