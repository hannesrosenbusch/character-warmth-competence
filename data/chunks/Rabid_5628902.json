  "1": "EXT. HILLY COUNTRY ROAD -- DAY\n\nA large, black, powerful-looking motorcycle waits propped up\non its center stand on the gravel shoulder of a deserted\ncountry road. The gold lettering on its tank and side covers\nidentifies it as a Norton Commando 850.\n\nTwo white Bell full-coverage helmets sit on its saddle, like\nmedieval jousting helmets.\n\nBeyond the motorcycle, stretched out on a grassy rise, lie\nHart Read, twenty-six, and his long-time girlfriend Rose,\nwho is the kind of eighteen that often seems more like\nfifteen, and once in a while like twelve.\n\nAt the moment Rose is definitely eighteen and in control of\nthings, producing tuna sandwiches with lettuce and mayonnaise\nout of a string bag and pouring coffee, pre-mixed with sugar\nand milk, from a small thermos flask. Read watches her play\nhousewife with vast amusement. Rose holds out a sandwich.\n\nREAD\nWhat've we got, Rose? Steak on a\nbun?\n\nROSE\n\nTuna with lettuce and mayo. You gonna\nmake trouble?\n\nREAD\nYeah. Big trouble.\n\nHe grabs Rose's wrist and pulls her close. He looks her deep\nin the eyes.\n\nREAD\nI want steak.\n\nRead kisses her full on the mouth. Rose drops the sandwich\ninto the grass.\n\nREAD\nSteak.\n\nThey kiss passionately.\nEXT. HILLY COUNTRY ROAD -- DAY -- ONE HOUR LATER\n\nRead kicks the big Norton into life. Rose puts on her helmet,\n\fdoes up the chin strap, and gets on the machine behind Read.\nRead waits for her to get settled, blips the throttle, then\naccelerates off the shoulder of the road, fishtailing slightly\nin the gravel.\n\nEXT. HILLY COUNTRY ROAD -- DAY\n\nThe Norton booms along the twisty two-lane road. The road is\nclear and Read feels good. He opens the throttle even more,\nalmost becoming airborne over the crest of a steep rise, and\nleaning the bike over in the corners until he scrapes rubber\noff the footpegs.\n\nRose rides loose, completely at ease behind Read.

CLINIC DRIVEWAY -- DAY\n\nIn the middle of a landscaped triangle of lawn stands a large\nlight-box-style sign which reads KELOID CLINIC OF COSMETIC\nSURGERY. Along one side of the triangle runs a crushed-gravel\ndriveway at the end of which is a long, low garage just behind\nthe main building, which looks as though it might once have\nbeen a small stable.\n\nOne of the three doors of the garage slides up and a van\npeels rubber out of the garage, sliding a bit once it hits\nthe gravel. The van is set up inside and out exactly like a\nstandard big-city ambulance, but without any ambulance\nmarkings. Instead, sedate white lettering on the doors reads\nKELOID CLINIC, LTD.\n\nEXT. FIELD -- DAY\n\nRead lies crumpled at the base of the tree. The end of his\n\nright collarbone is sticking out at a bizarre angle and his\nright shoulder is hanging too low. Read has regained enough\nconsciousness to feebly undo his helmet with his left hand.\n\nBeyond him, clouds of oily black smoke curl skywards from\nthe fallen Norton.

The graft tissue will\nbe frozen and sent to the Sperling\nInstitute. We'll have to keep the\npatient in an operation-ready state\nuntil it comes back to us. That's\ngoing to be a bit trying for all of\nus, but it can't be helped.\n\nAs Keloid speaks, the sections of thigh skin are placed in\nspun aluminum cylinders of the same general type as those\nused in eye banks. The cylinders are then sealed and placed\nin a medical freezer.\n\nRITA\nI don't understand the functional\ndifference between neutral field and\nnormal graft tissue, Doctor.\n\nKELOID\nWell, when the thigh skin tissue is\ntreated, Nurse Benedetto, it'll lose\nits specificity as both thigh tissue\nand skin tissue. For example, if it\nwere grafted to a burned cheek, it\nwouldn't just be thigh skin with the\ncolor and texture of thigh skin --\nit would actually develop as facial\ntissue. In other words, neutral field\ntissue has the same ability to form\nany part of the human body that the\ntissue of a human embryo has.\n\nKARL\nDoctor, this patient has lost most\nof her absorptive intestinal mucosa.\nCould neutral field tissue reconstruct\nan organ as complex as the small\nintestine.\n\nKELOID\nYes, Dr. Karl. I think that under\nthe right circumstances it could.\nI've done it myself using lab animals\n\fat the Sperling Institute.\nKeloid and Roxanne exchange glances, then Keloid looks away.\n\nKELOID\nLet me add that there is always a\npossibility that carcinomas will\nform when neutral field grafts are\nused internally. In this case, we're\nusing a radical plastic-surgery\ntechnique to compensate for our lack\nof heavy medical hardware. We're\ndoing it to save a life. It's the\nonly trick we've got.\n\nEXT.",

Read's left hand is encased\n\nin a wire cage which supports all his fingers. He is watching\nRose intently, who is still in a coma and is attached to a\nbattery of intravenous bottles connected to her by clear\nvinyl tubes and IV needles.

She then raises her left\n\narm and presses her left armpit flat against the cow's side.\nAfter a pause, she gives a short, sharp push with her left\nside, as though she's pushing something into the cow with\n\nher body. The cow responds by lifting up its head and turning\nto look at her.

This is\nnot just a question of swine flu or\nsomething like that. We have already\nseveral deaths on our hands in this\none small area alone, and the main\nproblem is... we don't know what\nwe're up against.\n\nINTERVIEWER (0.C.)\nAre you saying that this is not an\noutbreak of rabies?\n\nLAPOINTE\nI'm not saying that.

Now,\nthat's quick, much quicker than normal\nrabies. Then the victim begins to\nsweat, to shake, to foam at the mouth.\nThat's not so rare.

The only human activity is centered around\na convoy of heavy white city garbage trucks manned by white-\nuniformed, hooded figures.

The bathinette is half-\nfilled with bloody bath water, which has been leaking on to\nthe carpeting, drop by drop, for hours.\n\nCypher lets the lid drop down with a mixture of fear and\nhorror suddenly stabbing him in the pit of the stomach. An\ninsane kind of moaning giggle drifts over to him from the\ncorner of the room.\n\nHe whirls to face the sound. It seems to be coming from the\ncloset. Drawn inexorably toward the sound, he approaches the\ncloset, which is not completely closed. He raises his hand\n\fto grasp the doorknob.\n\nWithout warning, the closet door explodes open, smashing\nCypher in the face and knocking him to the floor.

There are more people on this\nparticular street than the ones he and Cypher first\nencountered. In fact, were it not for the heavily armed\nsoldiers placed at several strategic points and the single\n\fguarded garbage truck making its rounds, all would seem\nnormal. The sound of sporadic gunfire in the distance seems\nto have been accepted as everyday fare by everybody.\n\nBut Read's focus of attention is on the car radio. He has\nbeen listening to an analysis of the possible origins of the\ndisease and the information he's getting is disturbing him.\nThe voice on the radio is that of Dr. Royce Gentry.\n\nGENTRY (V.O.)\nAnd so after using some rather\nelaborate tracking procedures and\napplying them to a map, we find that\nthe disease does in fact seem to\nhave a very specific place of origin.\n\nINTERVIEWER (V.O.)\nWhich is...?\n\nGENTRY (V.O.)\nWhich is the Keloid Clinic of Cosmetic\nSurgery, a few miles outside the\ntown of Camelford.
