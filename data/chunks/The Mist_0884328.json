A long silence.\n\nDAVID\nOur front window was broken open.\nThe tree...my grandfather's tree...\n\nHe looks around, sees:\n\nA familiar floppy sun hat is caught in a tangle of webbing at\nthe side of the house, swaying slightly in the breeze. His\nwife's hat, the one she was wearing the last time we saw her.\n\nWE PAN from the hat to a pale dead foot dangling from a cocoon\nembedded in the branches of the downed tree.\n\nIt hits David hard. He knew it all along, but had to know for\nsure. Now he does. He glances to Billy. The boy is in Amanda's\nlap, mercifully asleep. Amanda has no words of comfort to\noffer. From the back seat:\n\nIRENE\nI'm sorry, David. Truly sorry.\n\f107.\n\nDavid nods, puts it in gear. He turns the Scout around and\nheads back up the driveway... :\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\nINT/EXT.
