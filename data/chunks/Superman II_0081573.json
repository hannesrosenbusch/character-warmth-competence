OUTSIDE THE COUNCIL OF ELDERS CHAMBER - KRYPTON NIGHT\n\n\tAll is still. A KRYPTONIAN GUARD stands at sentry beside massive crystalline portals.\nSuddenly, silently, NON appears behind him and slips a massive arm across his throat. He \nsqueezes, cutting off the guard's breath: the guard crumples silently, and drops to the floor.\n\n\tNow GENERAL ZOD and URSA step INTO FRAME.

This imposing crystalline space, the parliament of \nKrypton, is empty for the moment. But the signs of its members are ever-present: around the great floating slab that is their conference table each has his (or her) own console of crystals - a transparent container marked with the identifying insignia, c.f. the symbols on each of their robes in Part I.\n\n\tAs Non and Ursa follow two paces behind. Zod strides along the slab, ignoring console after \tconsole, stopping only when he reaches the one emblazoned with the S-like crest of Jor-El.\n\n\tANGLE DOWN ON IT as Zod lifts the lid of the console and removes, from among all \n\ttransparent crystals, the one red crystal.\n\n\tPAN UP as he lifts it high. It glows even in the dim light of the empty chamber - until Zod,\nwith a satisfied and sinister smile, snaps it in half. He tosses it to the ground and looks with a \nself-congratulatory air at Ursa and Non.\n\nEFECTS: The luminous Spinning Rings (c.f.

The MARINES take their positions, all eyes on the door, as suddenly: ZOD, NON and URSA burst down through the ceiling, shattering three glass domes which comprise part of it. The MARINES, POLICE, and SECRET SERVICE open fire through the shower of falling glass, send a withering barrage ricocheting around the room. ZOD watches triumphantly, the bullets bouncing harmlessly off him as URSA and NON go to work: URSA flings the advancing MARINES through the air, sends them crashing into one another as NON smashes the corridor pillars, then turns his attention to the machine-gun nest which blazes away at him.
