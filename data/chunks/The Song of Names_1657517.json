The reptile turns out to be a well-\ndressed crowd swirling around the entrance to the hall and\nfunnelling slowly into it; the same rain rolling down posters\nadvertising the event they’ve all come to see: the debut\nconcert of David Eli Rapoport, 21 year-old virtuoso\n\nviolinist.\n\nBBC RADIO PRESENTER (V.O.)\nIt is sometimes said that both the\nshortest and the longest distance\nin art is that between the very\ngood and the truly great.
