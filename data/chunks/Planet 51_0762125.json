CAMERA MOVES to find the back of a\ncar where two teenagers are kissing. The angle is SUPER\nTIGHT, the lighting dark, so we CAN'T SEE THEIR FACES.\n\nONE WAY TO ACCOMPLISH THIS: As we REVEAL the car, the\nautomatic convertible top is coming down. When we see the\ncouple inside, it's from behind the now scrunched rear\nwindow. The framing of the window cuts off the tops of their\nheads, hiding their antenna.

The\ncar starts shaking.\n\nFrom the front of the car, an alien ship rises up over the\ncliff. It's monstrously huge, though a cheap-looking 50's\nsci-fi model.\n\nTEENAGE GIRL\nI knew this would happen if we made\nout!\n\nThe teens SCREAM and the car takes off.\n\fThe car zooms down the empty road, dodging lasers from the\nalien ship.\n\nSuddenly, the car grinds to a halt, trapped. The alien ship\nis about to strike when...\n\nBLAM! It's hit with one artillery round.\n\nREVEAL dozens of soldiers with tanks and artillery are in\nposition and ready for battle.\n\nFrom behind the alien ship, a dozen more approach from the\nsky.\n\nThe hatch of the first ship opens.
