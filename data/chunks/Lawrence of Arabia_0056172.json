It is a level\ndesert. CAMERA is in rear of a travelling staff car. In the front\nare the DRIVER and LAWRENCE. There is no sound but the wind\nand the engine. An Army lorry passes us in the opposite direction;\nthen the staff car must slow down for a file of BEDOUIN on camels\ngoing in the same direction.\n\nCLOSE SHOT. LAWRENCE. He stands and peers up hopefully\ninto their faces as the car crawls past.\n\nMEDIUM TRACKING SHOT. P.O.V. LAWRENCE. Their faces.\nThey show no sign of recognition. We hear the car accelerating,\nand accelerating, we leave them behind in our dust.\n\nCLOSE TRACKING SHOT.

The level\ndesert swings endlessly past us. A second Army lorry approaches\nand swings past us, full of Tommies singing a music-hail ditty of\nthe period. (‘Goodbye Dolly, I must leave you...) The sound of\ntheir singing disappears swiftly behind us and immediately an Army\nDispatch Rider on a motor bicycle passes in the same direction.\n\nWe glimpse the RIDER and the screen is enveloped in the dust which\nhis machine throws upwards.\n\nTHE END\n\f"
