They made business deals\n\n               along the way -- buying an island, or\n\n               marrying a princess and inheriting her\n\n               land.

HERMAN (CONT'D)\n\n                   That's right. It's an octopus. Such a\n\n                   funny creature with its eight legs.\n\n                   But did you know octopi are actually\n\n                   extremely intelligent, like dogs and\n\n                   cats? They have unique personalities,\n\n                   and just like us they have a lot of\n\n                   defense mechanisms. I'm sure you know\n\n                   about the ink sac. She uses ink to\n\n                   confuse her predators. She can\n\n                   camouflage herself. She can emit\n\n                   poison, and some can mimic more\n\n                   dangerous creatures, like the eel. I\n\n                   keep her to remind me of our defense\n\n                   mechanisms -- our ink, our camouflage,\n\n                   our poison, all the things we use to\n\n                   keep away hurt. The reason Dr.\n\n                   Johnston invited me here today is to\n\n                   meet you, Scottie.
