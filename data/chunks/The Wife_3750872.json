CASTLEMAN BEDROOM, CONNECTICUT -- NIGHT, OCTOBER 1992 1\n\nCLOSE ON the rumpled empty, half of a bed. The bedside table\nholds a stack of novels, a pair of reading glasses, note\npads, pencils.\n\nAll is silent except for the hum of a digital clock. We see\nthe face of the clock click to 2:45 AM.\n\nThen we hear the creak of floor boards and the lumbering\nfootsteps of a man returning to bed. The space in the bed is\nfilled with the figure of the novelist JOSEPH CASTLEMAN,\nearly 70's. He has the anxious, exhausted look of someone\nwho doesn't have a prayer of sleeping. Joe is a handsome,\naging Brooklyn boy turned literary giant. He has the beard\nand the bearing of a proper eminence grise but he is also an\nunapologetic sensualist. He embraces all that life has to\noffer with a greedy, passionate vigor -- which, the critics\ntell us, is what makes his writing so rich.\n\nCRINKLE, CRINKLE, CRINKLE...Joe starts unwrapping a package\nof Hostess Snowballs which he’s brought back to bed with him.\n\nNext to him, JOAN CASTLEMAN, his wife of 40 years, is on her\nside, eyes shut, but awake, trying for sleep. She's five\nyears his junior -- an elegant, educated, deeply self-\npossessed shiksa from the upper-east side who was bred to be\na muse and helpmate to some brilliant, charismatic man.\n\nCRINKLE, CRINKLE...\n\nJOAN\nJoe. What’re you doing?\n\nJOE\nI'm hungry.\n\nJOAN\nDon't eat sugar, it'll keep you up.\n\nJOE\nListen, if it doesn’t happen I\ndon't want to be around for any of\nthose sympathy calls.
