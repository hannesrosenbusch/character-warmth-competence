The late sun turns the sand every colour from\ncrimson to black and makes the dunes look like bodies pressed\nagainst each other.\n\nAn old AEROPLANE is flying over the Sahara. Its shadow swims\nover the contours of sand.\n\nA woman's voice begins to sing - Szerelem, szerelem, she cries,\nin a haunting lament for her loved one.\n\nINSIDE the aeroplane are two figures. One, A WOMAN, seems to be\nasleep. Her pale head rests against the side of the cockpit.\nBehind her THE PILOT, a man, wears goggles and a leather\nhelmet. He is singing, too, but we can’t hear him or the plane\nor anything save the singer’s plaintive voice.\n\nThe plane shudders over a ridge. Beneath it A SUDDEN CLUSTER OF\nMEN AND MACHINES, camouflage nets draped over the sprawl of\ngasoline tanks and armoured vehicles. An OFFICER, GERMAN,\nfocusses his field glasses. The glasses pick out the MARKINGS\non the plane. They are in English. An ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN swivels\nfuriously.\n\nShocking bursts of GUNFIRE. Explosions rock the plane, which\nlurches violently. The fuel tank is punctured. It sprays out\ngasoline, then erupts in flame engulfing both figures in a\nfireball.\n\nINT. TRAIN. ITALY 1944.
