In his early forties. His house is\nfilled with expensive art, perfectly appointed furniture,\nand high ceilings. A fireplace rages, making the room\ndance with light. We almost feel as if we’re in hell.\n\nDIANA, his estranged wife, a beautiful woman, clutches a\ntowel. She’s been crying buckets. Her eyes are red and\nswollen. She holds her son ADAM, about seven, close, in a\nprotective way. It’s as if Jack is a stalking animal that\ncould do them both harm.\n\nLightning flashes again. Jack stands in front of a DUFFLE\nBAG. It is filled with PACKETS OF MONEY. Hundreds and\nhundreds of thousands. Or is it millions? He closes the\nbag and locks it. He looks at Diana and tries to\ncommunicate from a place deep inside.\n\nJACK\nI’m gonna get him back Diana.\n\nShe doesn’t answer. She stares with contempt and rage. As\nJack begins to head out of the house...\n\nJACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)\nI had several million dollars in a duffle\nbag and had to go and see a bunch of low\nlife Russian mobsters, who would most\nlikely cut my throat, take the money, and\nkill a kid they think is my son for\nsport.\n\nEXT. - JACK’S HOUSTON HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nIt's just as beautiful as the inside, surrounded by a\nprivate gate. Jack runs through the rain towards his\nMercedes with the DUFFLE BAG.\n\nJACK (V.O.)\nIt doesn’t get any more fucked up than\nthis. I was dealing with the kind of\nsavages who’d beat their mothers to death\nfor a ham sandwich.

Stay on\nthe TV, a US Senator now gives a speech on how he’s going\nto clean up the world. Later, in his hotel room, he jerks\nit furiously while wearing women’s underwear.\n\nJACK (V.O.)
