Lincoln, in a black\n\n          overcoat and his stovepipe hat, and Treasury Secretary\n\n          WILLIAM FESSENDEN, 59, stand by the pole. They face an\n\n          audience of officials, clerks, dignitaries, wives, soldiers.\n\n          A Marine band finishes a jaunty instrumental rendition of \"We\n\n          Are Coming Father Abra'am.\"\n\n           12.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          Two soldiers fasten a flag to the halyards.

Then he looks up.\n\n                         \n\n                          LINCOLN\n\n           The part assigned to me is to raise\n\n           the flag, which, if there be no\n\n           fault in the machinery, I will do,\n\n           and when up, it will be for the\n\n           people to keep it up.\n\n                         \n\n          He puts the paper away.

Some say they don't\n\n           exist. I don't know. I decided I\n\n           needed them to exist to uphold my\n\n           oath to protect the Constitution,\n\n           which I decided meant that I could\n\n           take the rebels' slaves from `em as\n\n           property confiscated in war.

I use the law allowing\n\n           for the seizure of property in a\n\n           war knowing it applies only to the\n\n           property of governments and\n\n           27.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n           citizens of belligerent nations.\n\n           But the South ain't a nation,\n\n           that's why I can't negotiate with\n\n           'em.

So I confiscated `em.\n\n           But if I'm a respecter of states'\n\n           laws, how then can I legally free\n\n           `em with my Proclamation, as I\n\n           done, unless I'm cancelling states'\n\n           laws? I felt the war demanded it;\n\n           my oath demanded it; I felt right\n\n           with myself; and I hoped it was\n\n           legal to do it, I'm hoping still.\n\n                         \n\n          He looks around the table.

They\n\n           might well decide that. Say there's\n\n           no amendment abolishing slavery.\n\n           Say it's after the war, and I can\n\n           no longer use my war powers to just\n\n           ignore the courts' decisions, like\n\n           I sometimes felt I had to do. Might\n\n           those people I freed be ordered\n\n           back into slavery? That's why I'd\n\n           like to get the Thirteenth\n\n           Amendment through the House, and on\n\n           28.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n           its way to ratification by the\n\n           states, wrap the whole slavery\n\n           thing up, forever and aye.

THE EAST PORTICO OF THE CAPITOL - NOON\n\n                         \n\n          Lincoln, wearing spectacles, stands at a podium before the\n\n          Capitol Dome, still under scaffolding, under cloudy skies. He\n\n          reads from the two pages.\n\n                         \n\n                          LINCOLN\n\n           Yet, if God wills that it continue\n\n           until all the wealth piled by the\n\n           bondman's two hundred and fifty\n\n           years of unrequited toil shall be\n\n           sunk, and until every drop of blood\n\n           drawn with the lash shall be paid\n\n           by another drawn with the sword, as\n\n           was said three thousand years ago,\n\n           so still it must be said \"the\n\n           judgments of the Lord are true and\n\n           righteous altogether.\"\n\n                         \n\n          He glances at his audience: 40,000 people from all over the\n\n          country, wounded soldiers, civilians in black. And for the\n\n          first time, in the crowd, not at its edges, hundreds of\n\n          African Americans, civilians and soldiers.\n\n           126.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)\n\n           With malice toward none, with\n\n           charity for all, with firmness in\n\n           the right as God gives us to see\n\n           the right, let us strive on to\n\n           finish the work we are in, to bind\n\n           up the nation's wounds, to care for\n\n           him who shall have borne the\n\n           battle, and for his widow and his\n\n           orphan, to do all which may achieve\n\n           and cherish a just and a lasting\n\n           peace among ourselves and with all\n\n           nations.\n\n                         \n\n           FADE TO BLACK.\n\n                         \n\n                         THE END\n\n                          \n\n\n\n"
