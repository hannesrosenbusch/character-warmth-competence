His 5-year old\nbrother, Joseph, is already asleep, beside him.\n\nNARRATOR\nNapoleon was born at Ajaccio in\nCorsica on August 15th, 1769. He\nhad not been a healthy baby and his\nmother, Letizia, lavished him with\ncare and devotion. In middle age,\nhe would write about her from St.\nHelena.\n\nNAPOLEON (V.O.)\nMy mother has always loved me. She\nwould do anything for me.\n\nMAIN TITLES\n\nINT.

Candles are\nlit.\n\nNapoleon, age 9, sun-tanned, leaps out of bed, rubbing his\narms and shivering. He tries to pour a pitcher of water,\ndiscovering that it has frozen solid.\n\nNAPOLEON\nWho has been putting glass in my\npitcher? Look here, someone has\nfilled my pitcher with glass!\n\nDUFOUR\nOh, my goodness! Someone has\nfilled Bonaparte's pitcher with\nglass. Now, who on earth would do a\nthing like that?\n\nBREMOND\nOh, heavens, look someone has\nfilled my pitcher with glass too!\n\fMONK\nSilence! Silence! You should not\nmake fun of Monsieur Bonaparte, he\ncomes from a country where it is\nnever very cold. He has probably\nnever seen ice before.\n\nDUFOUR\nNever seen ice before? Oh, dear me\n-- how very odd.\n\nThe boys snicker.

FARM BRIENNE - DAY\n\nA lovely, late-summer afternoon. A small group of boys, in\ntheir school uniforms, are impatiently gathered around a\nrough table, covered with stacks of thick bread and jam and\ntin mugs of milk. The farmer's wife supervises things,\ncollecting a sou from each boy.\n\nNapoleon, 9, stands apart from the group, drinking his milk,\na book under his arm, lost in thought, gazing across the\ncornfield at the school buildings, which are beautifully\ncolored by the late sunlight.\n\nBREMOND\n(overly cheerful)\nGood afternoon, Bonaparte.\n\nNapoleon ignores him.\n\nBREMOND\nWhat are you reading?\n\nNo reply.

What language!\nDid you learn that from your\nmother, Bonaparte?\n\nBremond is 4 years older and much bigger than Napoleon.\n\nNAPOLEON\nFuck off!\n\nAt this moment, Dufour gives him a violent bump from behind,\nspilling milk all over his uniform and splattering the book.\n\nDUFOUR\nOh, goodness, my dear Bonaparte --\nI am clumsy.

Napoleon is\npart of a group of young officers loading and firing a\ncannon.\n\nNARRATOR\nThe practical professional training\nthat Napoleon would receive for the\nnext three years would give hima\nworking knowledge of all arms, and\nexpose him to the advanced military\nideas of du Teil, Bourcet and\nGuibert.\n\nEXT.

The map, about\nfour feet wide, is flapping noisily in the heavy gusts of\nwind, despite the four pairs of knees and hands struggling to\nhold it flat against the ground.\n\nINT. ROOM - NIGHT\n\nNapoleon's room at Valence. It is filled with books, mostly\nof military subjects, but well-stocked with poetry, history\nand philosophy. He is reading by candlelight. Outside we\nhear the sounds of revelry produced by less conscientious\nofficers.\n\nNARRATOR\nHis moods at this time were complex\nand varied.\n\nNAPOLEON (V.O.)\n\nLife is a burden for me.

It is a\nscene of pre-Raphaelite innocence and beauty -- the young\nofficer, smartly uniformed, the innocent girl in a flowing\nwhite dress.\n\nNARRATOR\nHe made friends with a family\ncalled Columbier, and would later\nwrite of his first flirtation with\ntheir daughter, Caroline.\n\nNAPOLEON (V.O.)\nIt will scarcely be considered\ncredible, perhaps, but our whole\nbusiness consisted in eating\ncherries together.\n\nEXT. LYON STREET - NIGHT\n\nIt is a witheringly cold winter night, in Lyon. People,\nbundled up to the eyes, hurry along the almost deserted\nstreet, past empty cafes which are still open.\n\nNapoleon, hands deep in his pockets, shoulders hunched\nagainst the cold, passes a charming, young street-walker,\nabout his own age.

He stops about 10 feet from Varlac's cart. The man\nof the people stands, hands on hips, glaring at Napoleon, who\nis now completely surrounded by the crowd.

You are\ncharged with the murder of\nMonseigneur de Bouchy and his son,\nand the burning of his chateau.\n\nVarlac whispers to several of the men standing around him.\nOne of them disagrees and forcefully shakes his head.\n\nVARLAC\nA revolution is not a polite\ndiscussion in a parlor, Citizen\nLieutenant.

The larger one is empty.\n\nNapoleon sits at the back of the room, still alone and\nawkward.\n\nServants snuff out the candles, leaving only the empty stage\nilluminated.\n\nIt begins to look like a musical evening until the entrance\nonto the stage of three very attractive girls, dressed in\nheavy winter costumes.\n\nThe three \"actresses\" begin to talk about being snowbound in\na desolate cabin, when their conversation is interrupted by\nthe entrance of three young desperados.\n\f19.\n\nThe purpose of this entertainment quickly reveals itself as\nthe young men proceed to strip off the girls' clothing and\nhave intercourse with them.\n\nThe distinguished audience sits coolly appreciative of the\n\"sextet.\"\n\nNapoleon, still the provincial, can scarcely believe his\neyes.\n\nJosephine, seated next to Barras, watches the proceedings, an\nimperturbable study of elegance and charm. Barras takes her\nhand and smiles at her. She whispers something to him and he\nnods, gravely.\n\nEXT.

Seated\nat it are General Danican, the emigre leader of the mob, and\nGeneral Menou, his government opposite number.

I\nexaggerate all the dangers, and all\nthe disasters that might occur. I\nlook quite serene to my staff, but\nI am like a woman in labor. Once I\nhave made up my mind, everything is\nforgotten, except what leads to\nsuccess.\n\nA cloud of sharp-shooters, some mounted, some on foot,\nadvance to harass the enemy, escaping from his superior\nnumbers, by their mobility, and from his cannon by their\ndispersal.\n\nNapoleon studies this exchange of fire to better understand\nthe enemy's position. Surrounded by his entourage, he is on\na wooded platform constructed in the top branches of a large\ntree, overlooking the battlefield.\n\nNAPOLEON (V.O.)\nThe art of war is a simple art.\nEverything is in the execution.",

It\nis all common sense. Theory does\nnot enter into it. The simplest\nmoves are always the best.\n\f38.\n\nWhen the French skirmishers finally reveal a chink in the\nenemy position, it becomes a focal point for the main effort.\n\nHorse artillery are sent forward, on the gallop, to open fire\nwith canister at close range.\n\nThe main attacking force of infantry are then sent forward,\nmoving up in columns and lines.\n\nThe cavalry trots beside them, in the gaps, to make their\npresence felt where it will be best used.\n\nDrummers and bands fill the air with stirring music.\nOfficers march smartly alongside their men.\n\nThe precision of these attacking maneuvers is very important\nbecause the sight of the slow moving, perfectly aligned mass\nof infantry is more frightening and discouraging to the\ndefender than a wild bayonet charge.\n\nWhen the two main forces are about 100 yards apart, the\nCommanding Officer in the field starts the chant \"Hymn to\nVictory\" and places his hat, with its large tricolored\ncockade, on the point of his sword so that is can be seen by\nall of his troops.\n\nWhen the distance narrows to about 50 yards, the defending\nAustrians fire their first volleys -- first row, second row,\nthird row.\n\nThe French fall everywhere, but the remainder fill in the\nformation and keep moving in regular step.\n\nThis is the crucial point of the battle. The defenders now\nhave to decide whether they are going to run or face the\nattackers' volley and subsequent bayonet charge. There is no\ntime for the defenders to reload.\n\nNow the French are 20 yards away and still hold their fire,\ntrained to do this because their psychological advantage is\nlost once they have discharged their muskets. They want the\ndefenders to break and run.\n\nNow panic has begun to set in and to dislodge the defending\nAustrian troops. They start to give way.\n\nThe French relentlessly move forward.\nThe Austrian movements at the rear become a stampede.\n\nThe officers signal with their swords, and the drummers beat\nthe charge. The sky rings with a thousand battle cries.\n\f39.\n\nThe cavalry dashes forward and hacks down the fleeing\nAustrian infantry, who are virtually helpless against the\ncavalry out in the open.",
