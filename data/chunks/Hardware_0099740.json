THE WASTELAND - DAWN\n\nThe Darkness becomes a shifting veil of sand and we are inside\nthe funnel of a dust storm.

Then the veil closes again, shifting to reveal a\nnew tableau.\n\nAbstract shapes silhoutted against a red sky.\n\nA steel fence post.\n\nA coil of barbed wire.\n\nA body, its outline softened by the dust, broken and half-buried,\nits ragged uniform fluttering in a mockery of life.\n\nA glint of dusty metal.\n\nA minefield laid bare by the restless wind.\n\nAnother shape gains resolution in the dust.\n\nA steel hand appears, jointed fingers pointed skyward, veins an\nintricate web of cables and hydraulic tubing, born of fire.\n\nA seething dust cloud appears low on the horizon, a dark shape\nemerging from its swirling grain, fluttering for a moment like a\ngrounded bat, drawing closer, becoming the figure of a NOMAD\nswathed in a flapping scarf and a ragged duster, face shadowed by\na wide-brimmed hat, shoulders hunched beneath the weight of a\nbulging military backpack. He holds a long stick like a spear in\none hand and as he approaches we see the sunlight glistening on\nhis tinted blast goggles and on the transparent respirator that\nprotects his face.\n\nThe nomad is moving hurriedly, trying to keep ahead of the storm,\nhis eyes nervously scanning the horizon.\n\nThere is a sharp crack and two flares drift down behind him like\nwill-o’-the-wisps falling from the red sky.\n\nHe glances around and his eyes catch a glint of metal through the\ngloom.\n\nSlowing, he weaves his way across the minefield, feeling out a\npath with the tip of his stick, his eyes focused on a shape\nburied beneath a low ridge of sand.",

Crash helmets and motorcycle\nfenders blend into the screaming faces of grotesquely customized\ndomestic androids, reaching waldo arms and webs of barbed wire\nand rubber tubing filling every square inch of the bedroom,\nbathroom, kitchen and connecting hallway.\n\nA digital clock radio on the stereo system flicks to \"6:00 A.M\"\nand HEAVY METAL comes crashing forth from the radio.\n\nINT.

The metal worker\ncurses, turns off the gas and crosses to a computer control\nconsole in the lounge, On the way, she turns down the music to a\ndull throb.\n\nShe props up her welding mask and types a series of digits into\nthe computer. Her face is prematurely careworn but attractive.\nShe's in her late twenties, her hair hanging in strands, her face\nslick with sweat.

MO is\nstill young, his muscular build betraying long hours of obsessive\nbench pressing. His blond hair is close-cropped and he wears\npatched and fazed military uniform, his shirt unbuttoned to\nreveal a vest that is hand-painted with a blazing skull.

ROBOT BREAKER'S WAREHOUSE - DAY\nMo and Shades step through the sliding doors into a large hall.\n\nIt’s wide as an aircraft hanger, lit by hanging flourescent tube\nand dusty skylights.\n\fThe remains of gutted electronic equipment and dismembered\nandroids are stacked everywhere, mechanical limbs and hydraulic\ntubing dangling from the rafters, giving the place the appearance\nof a cannibal's den. ALVY, a dwarf clad in threadbare, grease-\ncovered overeralls and holding a spanner in one hand, is hunched\nover the shivering, partly-animated torso of a malfunctioning\ndomestic bot. He looks up from his work at the approaching pair\nand grins.\n\nALVY.\nWell, well, well. Taking a little vacation,\nhuh? Is this authorized?\n\nMo slips the bag of his shoulder.

You got something to sell?\n\nThe nomad tips his head foreward. Eyes Mo awhile. Then... what\nthe hell. He nods. Unloads his sack on the table. Steel skull,\ndismembered metal arms, a limbless torso - tubing spilling from\nthe guts -- and several spidery subsidiary arms terminating in\npincers and drill bits.\n\nSHADES\nWhat the fuck?\n\nShades picks up the skull, awestruck.

STREET - DAY\n\nThe temperature is still rising and heat shimmers in the sealed\ntar and concrete valley of the street.

Knots of figures sit clustered like\nbarnacles in the shade of each supporting pillar of the elevated\nroadway, their legs almost under the wheels of the traffic. There\nis a low RUMBLE as a truck passes on an overhead expressway.\n\fMo and Shades pass a row of rusting, wheelles cars, smoke rising\nfrom the chimneys in their roofs. Several TEENAGERS are busy\nbeating up a WINO they’ve got pinned against one of the hoods.\nThe wino breaks free and comes stumbling across Mo’s path. He\nfalls to one knee, grasping at Mo’s leg, begging inarticulately\nfor help. The kids LAUGH.\n\nMo looks menacingly at them, his hand falling to the butt of his\nshotgun. The kids clam up.

You're creasing the pants.\n\nMo pushes him away with the gun-barrel. The wino tumbles hard.

SHOWER - DAY\n\nJill's fingers fasten on the baseball bat.\n\nGrasping if with both hands she SLAMS it into the android's\nthroat.\n\nIt backs off an inch and she struggles violently to squirm out of\nits grasp.\n\nThe drill spins only inches awav from her flesh.\n\nIts mouth snaps at her, hvpodermic teeth dripping venom.\n\nIts claws tangle in her blanket and the fabric TEARS loudly as\nshe pulls away.\n\nShe kicks the android in the chest, breaking one of her toes and\nhurtling backwards, pulling right out of the blanket.\n\nThe blanket is still warm and for a moment the android is plainly\nconfused. The drill bites into empty cloth and Jill inches away.\nThe android looks up, clutching the rags.\n\nKnows it’s been tricked.\n\nThen Shades is suddenly in the doorway, leveling the Chief's\nautomatic at the android's head.\n\nThe gun jumps in his hand and the bullet WHINES off the\ncreature's armor plating, RICOCHETING around the cubicle in a\nspray of glass.\n\nJill SCREAMS and ducks and the android turns to Shades, looking\nat him as if he were no more a distraction than a fly. Shades\nstares back, red light glinting in his dark glasses. It is as if\nhe hears a countdown for a lift-off echoing in his mind.\n\nThe android tenses, preparing to spring.\nShades levels the gun again, finger tightening on the trigger.\n\nJill tries to regain her footing but her leg no longer seems to\nrespond.\n\nShe reaches for something to grab hold of.
