And discovers he's gone.\n\nThe women bolt out the door, just in time to glimpse a man\nin a navy jacket disappear down the subway stairs in the\ndistance.  In hot pursuit, Faith flings off her heels and\nsends them flying.  One of them BONKS a PASSER-BY, another\nMAN clad in a white shirt and carrying a navy jacket, on the\nhead.  We may get only a brief look at this guy, but it's\nenough to establish that while he may not be drop-dead\ngorgeous, any woman with any sense wouldn't kick him out of\nbed for munching saltines either.   There's an undeniable\nwarmth in his eyes.\n\nBut Faith doesn't see him at all, because as he bends down\nto pick up her shoe, he disappears from sight in the crowd,\nand she races madly past him.  Down the subway stairs, into\nthe tunnel-- and into a mob.\n\nINT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT\n\nShe battles her way through the throng, hopping up and down\nto try to get an overview, but there is no sign of him.  She\ndashes from car to car, pounding on windows, calling out his\nname.  Until, in a sudden whoosh, the doors close, and the\ntrain speeds off into the night.\n\nBut she's still running after it.  Desperately.  Until it\nfinally vanishes around a corner, out of sight.  And she sinks\nto the ground, arms outstretched in the darkness...  in vain.\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. PIAZZA NAVONA - NIGHT\n\nCLOSE ON an abandoned shoe.
