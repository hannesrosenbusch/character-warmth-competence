Some of the letters\nare runic, mystical. The title fades out.\n\nThe VOICES distill to one familiar VOICE.\n\nThe swirling shapes begin to focus as we MOVE back.\nWe're watching a \"screen\" suspended in space.\n\nON THE SCREEN: An impassioned man speaks to a rapt crowd of\nHitler Youth. ADOLF HITLER, at the peak of his power.\n\nHITLER (German, no subtitles)\nWe will pass from the scene, but for you,\nGermany will live on. And when we are gone,\nit will be your duty to hold high in your\nclenched fist the banner which we raised out\nof nothingness. And I know it cannot be\notherwise, for you are flesh of our flesh and\nblood of our blood, and the same spirit that\nrules us burns in your young brains.\n\nToday, standing on this stage, I am but a\ntiny part of that which extends beyond, over\nthe whole of Germany, and we want you, German\nboys and German girls, to absorb all our\nhopes for the future of that Germany. We want\nto be one nation, and you, my youth, shall\nbecome that nation.\n\nWe want an end to classes and class\ndivisions, and you must keep such ideas from\nlooming within yourselves.\n\fTHE EMPTY MIRROR - final production script - June 5, 1995 p.",

We want\nthis nation to be obedient, and you must\npractice obedience. We want this nation to be\npeace-loving but brave as well, and you must\nbe peace-loving. You must be peace-loving and\nbrave at the same time.\n\n3 THE SPEECH NEARS IT'S END, THE CAMERA FINDS A\nSHADOWY FIGURE.\n\nStanding alone in the cell, near an old projector, studying,\nmesmerized by the images on the screen (the \"cell-screen\").\n\nWearing a suit from the thirties, this man resembles the man on\nthe screen: Hitler.\n\nThe projector's reels turn. The speech continues. The man in the\ncell becomes increasingly prideful, strong.\n\nHITLER (0.S., in German)\nGermany lies before us, Germany marches\nwithin us, and Germany comes after us!\n\nThe crowd answers, roaring: Sieg Heil! Ein Volk! Ein Reich!\nEin Fuhrer!\n\nAs the chanting fades, we get our first clear look at the man in\nthe cell, basking in the adulation. It's confirmed: this is ADOLF\nHITLER.\n\nHe turns a switch to reverse the film, stops, switches it\nforward. Adolf studies the last moments of the speech again.\nThe projected images allow him to drink from the memories of his\nold power. He is Narcissus at the pond.\n\nOff-frame, we hear the climax of Hitler's speech; and the crowd's\nroaring chant: \"SIEG HEIL! SIEG HEIL!\"\n\nAdolf stands watching. (we'll call him \"Hitler\" in historical\nimages, \"Adolf\" when in the cell)\n\nThe light reflects off the screen onto his face. As the CHEERS\nbegin to fade, the film clip comes to an end; followed by clear\nfilm leader.

The end of the leader SLAPS through the gate. The\nprojector lamp switches off.\n\nMUCH WIDER: The room goes dark.\n\nAdolf turns toward us, speaks the last lines of the speech,\nrepeating the gestures he used, perhaps trying to improve.\n\nADOLF\n\nGermany lies before us, Germany marches\n\nwithin us, and Germany comes after us!\nWe realize he's watching his reflection in a mirror.\nAfter a few moments he lifts both hands, fingers spread wide near\nhis face. Imploringly, he shakes them, this time with no emotion\n-- just scrutinizing the body language.\nHe smoothes down his suit jacket. Checks it for flaws, then\nthrows back his shoulders, stiffens his back and CLICKS his\nheels. He half-salutes himself.\n\nWe MOVE closer. Time SLOWS almost to a freeze. It's a long,\nuncomfortable moment.\n\nIt's interrupted by a TAPPING from off screen. Adolf snaps to\nguarded alertness.\n\n4 A LAMP ON A TABLE IS QUICKLY DOUSED.\nThe cell goes to shadows.\n\nCUT TO: A JAILER in a plain guard's uniform, tapping on the wall\nwith a long club (don't see his face here).\n\nHe passes behind Adolf, who now sits in a chair drawing ina\nsketchbook. The images: Nazi architecture, massive buildings and\nshrines for a new city.\n\nIn the background, the Jailer pokes around Adolf's bed with a\nclub, probing.\n\nApparently satisfied for now, the Jailer exits frame.\n\nAdolf turns the light back on, relaxes slightly, his face droops\nwith fatigue. He strokes the back of his hand.\n\fTHE EMPTY MIRROR - final production script - June 5, 1995 p.4\n\nIMAGES FLASH:\n5 A WOMAN'S LONG BLONDE HAIR - MOSTLY ABSTRACT.\nWe study its soft, appealing texture.\n\nInexplicably, a swarthy hand rises up through the hair, and then\ndisappears back down into it.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n6 STEAM.

We see Adolf's chest, his suit, a pin on the\nlapel -- a swastika in a circle.\n\nHot water pours from a faucet into an old porcelain sink. Adolf\nturns it off, dips his hands into the steaming water.\n\nThe steam rises in front of his face. He cleans his hands,\nnervous. Focused.\n\nHe begins to WHISTLE to himself -- a few bars from Wagner.\n(along with the sound track, as if he \"hears it\")\n\nSOUNDS: Distant SCREAMS, distant EXPLOSIONS, a ROARING inferno.\nIf Adolf hears them, its impossible to tell.\n\nHe dries his hands, and exits. We MOVE through the steam to:\n7 THE WALL\n\nIt's dark stone surface is rough, moist, with veins of black\nMinerals.\n\nWe move along the wall, and pass a distinct opening, a crumbling,\nrough hole created by a vertical crack in the stone. A faint\nbluish light shines through from the other side.\n\nWe continue along the wall to a table, on which we discover two\nframed photos. One of Adolf's mother: Large, light-gray eyes\nwith dark, penetrating pupils and a plain, anxious face. Then the\neyes of Hitler as a child.\n\nNearby is a partial wooden mask of Hitler, upside down.\n\nFinally, we discover Adolf, lying in his bed, his back to us.\n\nWith his right hand, he pinches compulsively at his left wrist,\nas if trying to get at something crawling just under the skin.\n\fTHE EMPTY MIRROR - final production script - June 5, 1995 p.5\n\nWe MOVE slowly in towards the back of his head until the frame is\nfilled with blackness.\n\nFADE UP FROM THIS BLACKNESS TO:\n\nthe gray, textured wall (an intentional repeat).
