INDOOR SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT\n\nWooden bleachers line the surrounding walls of the Olympic-\nsized pool. The room is empty. MOONLIGHT shines through the\nskylights, reflecting off the water. Nikes, Jay-Z T-shirt\nand an iTouch are piled at the pool's edge. CAMERA CRANES\nINSIDE the water. AT THE POOL'S BOTTOM, we find...\n\nPERCY JACKSON, age 17, sitting with his legs crossed, dressed\nin cargo shorts. His eyes are closed. His long, dirty\nblonde hair floats around him. His expression is peaceful.\n\nPERCY (V.0.)\nEver since I was a kid, I liked being in\nthe water. It's where I do my best\n\nthinking. Sometimes, when I concentrate,\n\nI hear this distant voice... like\nsomebody trying to guide me, give me\ndirection... Weird, huh?\n\nPercy opens his eyes, shoots to the surface, fills his lungs\nwith air.\n\nPERCY (V.O.)\nProbably just water on the brain.\n\nEXT. YANCY ACADEMY - DAY\n\nA large campus in upstate New York. Old, brick buildings are\nscattered across several well-manicured acres. Percy walks\nalone across campus, dressed like a Venice Beach surf rat,\nlistening to an iPod. His attitude is tough, hard, cool.\n\nPERCY (V.O.)\nMy name is Percy Jackson. Until a few\nmonths ago, I was a student here at Yancy\nAcademy. The kind of place where parents\nsend their \"troubled\" kids when no one\nelse will take them.\n\nA fight breaks out between a group of students. Teachers run\nto break it up.

A pair of rusted,\nmetallic FOREARM CRUTCHES lean against his roommate's bed.\nPercy lies awake, the walls around him covered with posters\nof SURFERS riding EXTREME WAVES. Tacked to the wall is a\nphotograph: Percy and his mom, in happier times.\n\nPERCY (V.O.)\nI was also supposed to have some\ndisplaced rage because my father\nabandoned my mom before I was born.\n\nBut quite honestly, none of that really\nmattered...\n\nDistant THUNDER roars.

I knew it.\n(extends his hand)\nBring it to me.\n\nPercy walks forward, places the bolt up into Zeus' GIGANTIC\nPALM. When it is placed into Zeus' hand, the bolt GROWS BACK\nto its normal size.\n\nZEUS\nCongratulations. You've managed to save\nwhat's left of your Father's reputation.\n\nPercy turns, exchanges his FIRST LOOK with Poseidon. Percy's\neyes remain COLD, HARD. He TURNS back to Zeus.\n\nPERCY\nI didn't steal the lightning bolt. If\nmy father had asked me to do something\nfor him, I would have said \"no\"\n(indifferent)\nI have no loyalty to him.

Annabeth looks at Athena and Poseidon.\n\nANNABETH\nI think it's about time you two\nstopped hating on each other.\n\nPoseidon and Athena sigh, holding back their anger, putting\naside their feelings.
