DINER - NIGHT 1 (SOMEWHERE IN OHIO) 1\n\nWe're in the kind of place that feels like everyone should\nknow your name. But they don’t. Families frequent this spot\nwhen they’ve fallen on hard times. It’s practically empty on\nthis boring Thursday. SERVERS drop off hot plates while\nELDERLY PEOPLE sip cheap coffee at the counter.\n\nOur focus is directed toward a BLACK MAN and a BLACK WOMAN\nsitting in a small booth in the back.\n\nThe MAN: has a slender frame and a laid back demeanor. He’s\nnot a fan of rocking the boat or ruffling feathers, but he\nain’t no punk either. For the purpose of this story we’ll\ncall him SLIM.\n\nThe WOMAN: She’s regal as fuck. She’s not an easy laugh and\nshe’s always waiting for the other shoe to drop. For the\npurposes of this story, we’ll call her QUEEN.\n\nNot unlike most first dates there are long silences and a lot\nof forced small talk.\n\nThe WAITRESS quickly drops off their food and walks away\nwithout uttering a word. Queen examines the spread.\n\nSlim prays over his food. This is how he was raised. Queen\nsits awkwardly waiting for him to look up.\n\nAs soon as he does --\n\nQUEEN\nDidn't you ask for scrambled eggs?\n\nSLIM\nYeah.\n\nShe clocks the two sunny side up eggs on his plate.\n\nSLIM (CONT'D)\nIt’s all good.\n\nQUEEN\nNo, it’s not.\n\nSLIM\nIt’s just eggs.\n\nQUEEN\nI have a thing about that.\n\nSLIM\nEggs?\n\fThey have\n\nQUEEN\nNo, about people not doing their\njob well.\n\nSLIM\n\nShe's got four kids and an\nalcoholic husband at home. She’s\ndoing the best she can.\n\nQUEEN\nHow do you know that?\n\nSLIM\nShe comes through my line every\nSunday, yelling at her kids and\ngiving me a stack of coupons. She\ncan never find her Costco card so I\nalways let her use mine so she can\nget the discount.\n\nQUEEN\n\nThat’s nice of you.",

It’s legal in 31 states. And\nOhio happens to be one of ‘em.\n\nSLIM\nWas he innocent?\n\nQUEEN\nEven if he’s not - the state\nshouldn’t decide whether he lives\nor dies.\n\nSLIM\nI’m sorry.\n\nQUEEN\nMe too.\n(then)\nNormally, I’d just go home and have\na glass of wine by myself.
