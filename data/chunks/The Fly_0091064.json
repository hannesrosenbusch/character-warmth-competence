You'll have to be more specific.\n\nBRUNDLE\nWhat, you want me to be specific here, in this room, with, uh... half the\nscientific community of North America eavesdropping?\n\nVERONICA\nIs there another way?\n\nBRUNDLE\n\nYou could come back to my lab. Listen, I'll make you cappuccino. I have a\nFaema of my very own. You know what that is? It's not the Dilettante's\nplastic kitchen model. It's one of those, uh uh., wh, real restaurant\nespresso machines with a-an eagle on top and...\n\n \n\nVERONICA\nSomehow I get the feeling you don't get out much.\n\nBRUNDLE\nYou can tell that?\n\nVERONCA\nYeah.\n\fBRUNDLE\nI think you're making a mistake. I think you really want to talk to me.\n\nVERONICA\nSorry, I have three other interviews to do before this party's over.\n\nBRUNDLE\nYeah, but they're not working on something that'll change the world as we\n\nknow it.\n\nVERONICA\nThey say they are.\n\nBRUNDLE\nYeah, but they're lying I'm not.\n\nINT.

Brundle reveals\nit as a third pod.\n\nBRUNDLE\nNo. This is the prototype of... those. The first one I had made. It, uh... it\nworks, but it's clunky. I call them telepods.

What happened?\n\nBRUNDLE\nYou get it, all right. You just can't handle it. Um... your stocking has just\nbeen teleported... from one pod... to another. Uh, disintegrated... there and\n\nre-integrated there. Mmm, sort of. It'll change the world as we know it,\nright?\n\nAs she speaks, Veronica pulls a dictaphone from her pocket and begins\nrecording the conversation.\n\nVERONICA\nOh, no! This is, uh...

Well, he found out the very hard\nand painful way that he eats very much the same way a fly eats. His teeth are\nnow useless because although he can chew up solid food, he can't digest it,\nsolid food hurts. So like a fly, Brundlefly breaks down the solid with a\ncorrosive enzyme, pleasurably called \"Vomit drop\". He regurgitates on his\nfood, it liquifies, and then he sucks it back up. You ready for a\ndemonstration kids? Here goes...\n\nINT. VERONICAS APARTMENT- NIGHT\nWe see Brundle on the screen in Veronica's apartment as Stathis watches it.\n\nSTATHIS\nMy God.

BRUNDLES LAB- NIGHT\n\nWe are close on Brundle's fingers as they dance over the keys of the computer\nkeyboard. Brundle has cut the fingers off a pair of yellow rubber kitchen\ngloves and jammed them down over his fingertips, so that his fingers won't\nstick to the keyboard.\n\nCU MONITOR which reads:\n\nGENE-SPLICING PROGRAM NOW IN PLACE\n\nTELEPOD 1: TRANSMITTER POD SUBJECT A\n\nTELEPOD 2: TRANSMITTER POD SUBJECT B\n\nTELEPOD 3: RECEIVER POD FOR GENETICALLY FUSED A-B COMBINATION SUBJECT\n\nWe pull back to see that in front of Brundle and his keyboard stand not two,\nbut THREE telepods, the third one of a somewhat older and more handbuilt\nvintage than the other two- the original PROTOTYPE TELEPOD which has been\nsitting in a corner of the lab under a tarpaulin and was noticed by Veronica\non her first visit to the lab. In TELEPOD A sits a monkey, in TELEPOD B an\nalley cat. TELEPOD C, the old prototype receiver, is empty. Brundle operates\nthe machine. The monitor says, READY FOR FUSION Brundle presses the ACCEPT\nbutton. The telepods go through their normal disintegration routine as the\nanimals' outlines appear on the monitor in split screen fashion. But now, as\nthe reintegration process begins, a stream of data concerning this new\nexperiment, the fusion of monkey and cat, floods the screen. The basic\nmessage that gets across to us through all the hi-tech compu-talk is:\nPERCENTAGE OF MONKEY-63 PERCENTAGE OF CAT-37\n\nThese numbers fluctuate as the machine tries to strike a molecular\nbalance between the two creatures. Finally, an outline of the fused creature\nbegind to form on the screen. brundle looks up to see the actual creature\nforming, and it is indeed grotesque: two heads- one monkey, one cat- at odd\nangles to each other, six legs which are not quite symmetrically placed on\nthe monkey torso, cat tail.",

Brundle gets up, goes to the third telepod, and with great\napprehension, opens the door. The thing just sits there, slumped for a beat,\nthen SUDDENLY LEAPS UP AT HIM, its two heads SHREIKING! It jumps on his arm,\nclinging, snarling, then drops to the floor. The two heads begin to bite each\nother, blood begins to flow- the thing now running around in mad floppy\ncircles, smearing blood everywhere. Brundle is horrified. He grabs a metal\nrod leaning in a corner and begins to smash at the deformed thing. He keeps\nsmashing at it until it stops its hideous screeching and lies dead, mangled\n\fon the floor. Brundle wraps it up in a towel and throws it into the\nrefrigerator. He draws the old torn sheet over the third telepod so he\ndoesn't have to look at it again. Back at the monitor, the screen is flashing\nthe words: FUSION SUCCESSFUL RECEIVER TELEPOD 3\n\nBrundle puts his face in his hands for a few moments, then pulls himself\ntogether. He pulls the rubber fingertips off his fingers and throws them to\nthe ground. Brundle has now developed some insect-like tics and mannerisms,\nhis head twitching with nervous little jerks and his long fingers in constant\nmotion. We see clearly now that all of Brundle's fly characteristics have\nbeen accentuated even further. The metallic-green hair which completely\ncovers his face is much thicker than before, and the hernia-like bulge in his\nside is more protuberant now, stretched to the bursting point and obviously\ncausing Brundle some pain. Brundle looks at the skylight. The sky is clear,\nthe moon is a scimitar. On an impulse, he jumps up on the wall, sticking\nthere for a beat. Then, with incredible agility, he ascends the wall, crosses\nthe celing toward the skylight. ON THE CEILING Brundle glides on all fours,\nupside down, towards the skylight.

EXT. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n LAB ROOFTOP-NIGHT\n\nBrundle clambers out of the skylight onto the roof. The night is gorgeous,\nclean and bright, the sky packed with stars. Brundle breathes deeply. He is\nstill alive, isn't he? He can still respond to the beauty of the night, can't\nhe?\n\nEXT. MONTAGE- BRUNDLE'S TRAVELS- NIGHT\n\nWe follow Brundle on his solitary sojourn in a MONTAGE SEQUENCE. He climbs\nwalls with amazing ability, leaps from rooftop to rooftop, hangs upside down\nfrom ledges and lampposts, eavesdropping on the city life around and below\nhim, the inhabitants unaware of the unusual and shadowy observer in their\nmidst. He scurries along the girder of a bridge, gazing down on the traffic\nand the river below him. These moments should be poetic, even beautiful,\njoyous. The moon is luminous, the dark night exquisite. Resigned to his fate\nand momentarily forgetful of his future, Brundle seems to be reveling in his\nunique powers. A brief euphoric fling.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nBrundle leaps across a narrow alleyway to the wall of the building opposite\nhim. He smiles with smug satisfaction at his feat, then suddenly winces,\ngrabbing his side with one of his hands. WE HEAR A CRACKING, SPLITTING SOUND.\nBrundle muffles a startled cry, and losing his balance, slides several feet\ndown the wall before regaining hold. He looks down at the huge bulge in his\nside and sees that it is starting to split open!\n\nBrundle is horrified and in pain. He starts to quickly move down the side of\nthe building but the pain impedes his progress. He manages to get down at\nleast another floor before he's hit with another sharp pain. He doubles up\nand his tenuous grip on the wall causes him to slide another several feet\ndownward before he regains his grip. The side is gaping wide now and\nSOMETHING is starting to protrude.

The insect leg now\nbegins to probe around, function like a real leg, almost with a mind of its\n\fown. Grotesque as Brundle has become, he can't accept the next step towards\nreal insectness which this new leg represents. He screams at the leg.\n\nBRUNDLE (SCREAMING AT THE LEG)\nNo! No, I won't! I won't, I won't, I won't..!\n\nBrundle grabs at the leg, holds it, subdues it and then begins to gnaw at it\nwith his teeth at its base, twisting himself into an agonized ball in order\nto do it. The leg begins to lever at his back, small hooklike protrusions all\nalong its underside catching in the flesh of Brundle's back, tearing it in\nprotest against Brundle's attempt at amputation. Finally, Brundle has severed\nthe leg with his teeth. The leg drops off leaving a strand or two of stringy\ngristle hanging from the knobby stump in Brundle's side. The leg twitches on\nthe ground, tries to extend itself. Brundle looks at the leg in shock, his\neyes crazed, like an animal who has been caught in a leg-trap and has had to\ngnaw off the leg to be free. Brundle tries to steady himself, then staggers\naway down the alley. As he goes, he wipes the insect blood from his lips with\nhis two forearms In exactly the same way that flies clean their faces.\n\nEXT.
