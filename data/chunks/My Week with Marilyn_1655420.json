It is majestic, an Englishman's dream of a home,\n\n           complete with turrets and even a moat. There is a feeling\n\n           of timeless beauty and stability about the scene, something\n\n           profoundly English.\n\n           We are a very long way from Hollywood.\n\n\n\n                          CUT TO:\n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n          3 EXT.

He has two STUDENTS with him, a man and a\n\n           woman in their early 20s, and is in mid-description of the\n\n           painting.\n\n\n\n                          KENNETH\n\n           ... and this is one of Carracci's\n\n           earlier works and one is able to\n\n           see the emergence of his now famous\n\n           Baroque style, which is clearly\n\n           rooted in the tradition of high\n\n           renaissance and antiquity...\n\n           COLIN pauses briefly and hurries towards them. Throughout the\n\n           scene there is a sense of his urgency and desire to go. The\n\n           whole thing should be played at breakneck pace. KENNETH beams\n\n           affectionately.\n\n\n\n                          KENNETH\n\n           Colin! Come in. Have you met James\n\n           and Anna?

They\n\n           watch one of OLIVIER's speeches (from the \" The Coconut\n\n           Girl\" sequence we saw filming in Scenes 61 and 62).

It is a copy of some rushes from\n\n           The Prince And The Showgirl, perhaps given to Colin by\n\n           Olivier, or perhaps \"borrowed\" as a souvenir and long since\n\n           forgotten.\n\n           We see MARILYN dancing happily, exaggerating off camera,\n\n           looking playful and sexy. She is radiant and full of life.\n\n           After a moment she turns and looks off camera - perhaps to\n\n           where Colin himself would have been standing - and winks\n\n           happily.\n\n           Blown up to the full size of the screen it is utterly sweet\n\n           and charming.\n\n           There is something so completely natural about the gesture\n\n           COLIN feels he has been swept back seven years in time and\n\n           MARILYN is standing in front of him again, in the flesh. It\n\n           moves and delights him; perhaps he has never even really seen\n\n           this clip before. At any rate he hasn't thought about it for\n\n           years.\n\n           It is MARILYN as he will always remember her, relaxed,\n\n           affectionate and vital, a part of her, however tiny, forever\n\n           his.\n\n           She smiles, laughs at something, giggles in delight (without\n\n           sound). She says something to an unseen crew member, then\n\n           looks back, smiling at the camera.\n\n\n\n          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 120.\n\n\n\n                         \n\n          Her face fills the screen.\n\n          Beautiful, timeless -\n\n          Happy.\n\n          HOLD on the image for as long as we dare, then -\n\n\n\n           FADE TO BLACK.\n\n\n\n                          THE END\n\n\n\n"
