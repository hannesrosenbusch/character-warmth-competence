Two Air Rescue helicopters are coming in low from the \n               north, descending to a point just outside the entrance to \n               the hospital Admitting Ward.\n\n               Transferring our attention to the helicopters, our gaze goes \n               from the first sign to a second one, on which all we can \n               read at first are the very large letters: \"M-A-S-H.\" Moving \n               closer to the helicopters as they hit the ground, we can \n               make out the rest of the sign. Above the four large letters \n               it says: \"4077TH,\" and then we see there is the remainder of \n               a word following each of the large letters, but in much \n               smaller print, so that \"M-A-S-H\" becomes \"Mobile Army Surgical \n               Hospital.\" The helicopters land and enlisted men of the U.S. \n               Army Medical Corps Carry two wounded soldiers from each into \n               the Admitting Ward.\n\n               LIEUTENANT COLONEL HENRY BLAKE, a permanent member of the \n               Medical Corps and Commanding Officer of the 4077th, watches \n               grimly as the wounded are borne from the helicopters into \n               his hospital.

There is a further voluntary piece of \n               segregation within the officers' section: the men  medical \n               officers plus a couple of administrative officers and a \n               helicopter pilot  are at one long, rectangular table; the \n               nurses, ranging in rank from second lieutenant to captain, \n               at another.\n\n               Hawkeye starts to lead the way to an empty table in the \n               officers' section, but Duke calls his attention to the \n               outstanding feature of the nurses' table: LIEUTENANT DISH, \n               24, blonde and clearly, even in her winter fatigues, the \n               sexiest looking nurse in military history.\n\n                                     DUKE\n                         What do you think of that piece of \n                         scenery, Yankee boy?\n\n                                     HAWKEYE\n                         Finest kind.

Duke is hungry enough to turn \n               his whole attention to the meal, but Hawkeye is unable to \n               keep his eyes off Lieutenant Dish while eating.

Trapper's job is repairing a lacerated pulmonary artery, or \n               some other delicate piece of surgery close to the heart and \n               involving a large chest incision. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n We see enough of the process \n               to observe that it is gory and deep inside a critical area, \n               but necessarily it is the reactions of the people watching, \n               especially Duke and Hawkeye, that tell us how tricky an \n               operation it is and how expertly Trapper is handling it.\n\n               The sequence is silent except for incidental operating room \n               noises.\n\n               Even Trapper's occasional terse instructions to his assistants \n               and his brief exchange with Ugly John are spoken too low for \n               us to hear.\n\n               There are four stages to the action:\n\n               1. The beginning of the operation before an attentive \n               audience, drawn by their interest in the new man and by the \n               fact that this is a surgical procedure they have never dared \n               to attempt.\n\n               2. Limited approval and professional respect for the assurance \n               with which Trapper plots his incision and starts working his \n               way to his destination.\n\n               3. Mounting tension as the crucial stage is reached. The \n               suspense reaches its crest during the few moments when Trapper \n               is doing the actual mending job to which all the preliminaries \n               have led. The faces of his colleagues express anxiety and \n               hope that he can accomplish what he set out to do, and \n               accomplish it quickly enough to permit the patient to survive. \n               Henry, not certain of his own judgment, looks to Duke for \n               confirmation, and Duke nods to indicate he thinks Trapper \n               has the situation under control.\n\n               4. The tension breaks as Trapper finishes the job to his \n               satisfaction and begins, along with his assistant surgeon, \n               to close up. Henry's smile of relief is unsure and only \n               tentative until he catches Hawkeye's signal that the job has \n               been done to perfection.\n\n                                                                TIME LAPSE:\n\n               EXT.

Hawkeye has a scalpel in his left hand and with it he \n               enlarges the wound around his right index finger. Then he \n               tries to slide a Kelly clamp down his finger into the wound \n               to clamp the artery but he can't manage it lefthanded.\n\n               He looks desperately around the OR only to observe that every \n               surgeon and nurse is fully engaged, including Henry and Hot \n               Lips.

LANDING AREA OUTSIDE 4077TH MASH  DAY\n\n               It is September. A helicopter descends to the ground in the \n               familiar location and, as on earlier occasions, Medical \n               Corpsmen come from the hospital to aid in unloading it. But \n               this time the cargo, instead of wounded men, turns out to be \n               boxes which the corpsmen rip open and which contains football \n               uniforms: black shoes, cardinal red jerseys, white helmets \n               and white pants.\n\n                                                                TIME LAPSE:\n\n               EXT. FIELD BEHIND OFFICERS' LATRINE  DAY\n\n               A day or two later. Fifteen men are wearing uniforms from \n               the chopper load. Practice at this point is confined to \n               kicking and passing the three footballs at their disposal, \n               and the uniforms still look clean and new. Trapper is a good \n               passer, Hawkeye is a better-than-average receiver, and Duke \n               punts well, but generally speaking, the balls are dropped \n               more often than they are caught, and the overall effect is \n               pretty ragged. Among the other players are Vollmer, Ugly \n               John, Boone, Painless and Judson. On the sidelines watching \n               are Henry, with a whistle tied to a piece of rubber hospital \n               tubing around his neck, and, in uniform, SPEARCHUCKER, a \n               very big, broad-shouldered black man in his early thirties.\n\n                                     SPEARCHUCKER\n                         If I can make a suggestion, Coach.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         The way I run an organization, any \n                         man in it has the right to speak his \n                         mind.\n\n                                     SPEARCHUCKER\n                         In that case, here are ten basic \n                         plays.

He is almost tackled again, and his only route \n               of escape is back toward his own goal line.\n\n                                     SPEARCHUCKER\n                              (from the sideline)\n                         Throw it! Throw it!\n\n               Faced with a loss of about twenty-five yards, Trapper spots \n               Hawkeye in the area of the line of scrimmage and whips the \n               ball to him.\n\n               Hawkeye catches it but there are tacklers all around him and \n               he goes down almost immediately for no gain on the play. \n               Moving faster than they have to in order not to give the \n               opposition any rest, the team huddles.\n\n                                     TRAPPER\n                              (to huddle)\n                         Wide to the left.

Duke is still a good ball carrier by college \n               standards and he has little trouble shaking off the amateurs \n               who try to tackle him, and is thus able to make it a running \n               duel with the professionals.",

Hawkeye has switched \n               to left end, Spearchucker replacing him in the backfield. \n               This time General Hammond's men are kicking off to Henry's. \n               It's a long kick but it doesn't go toward the center of the \n               goal line, where Spearchucker is waiting for it, but to Duke, \n               who runs toward Spearchucker and tosses him an easy lateral.\n\n               The two pro tackles from the Browns run down the field so as \n               to converge on Spearchucker around the Mash twenty-five. But \n               the other Mash players divide themselves into equal units of \n               five to do nothing but take out the two tackles. The other \n               opposing players are no problem for Spearchucker, who runs \n               around or right through them, and crosses their goal line \n               for a touchdown. The ball is brought out for the extra point \n               which Duke scores with a place kick. Before the teams \n               reassemble for the next kickoff, the captain of the 325th \n               team detours a few yards toward his bench and calls something \n               to General Hammond, whose reaction is to stand up and shake \n               his fist in Henry's direction.

The opposing team goes into another huddle but their \n               strategy remains as Radar overheard it. When the left halfback \n               starts to his right, the Mash players start to their right, \n               and after the right halfback takes over possession and tries \n               to turn in, he finds himself hopelessly outnumbered. \n               Spearchucker hits him first with a tackle so fierce it throws \n               him back five yards and induces him to fumble the ball. A \n               pile of half a dozen MASH players pounces on it, causing \n               some damage to each other.\n\n                                     SPEARCHUCKER\n                              (to Referee)\n                         Time!\n\n               He goes over to the Referee and exchanges a few words with \n               him, then walks into his team's huddle.\n\n                                     TRAPPER\n                              (to Spearchucker)\n                         You got to be the one.

Their \n               opponents have trouble adjusting to this and are even more \n               confused when, just as Trapper bends down to take the ball \n               from Vollmer, Hawkeye steps back into the backfield and Duke \n               squeezes into the already crowded right line. Returning the \n               ball to Vollmer, Trapper turns his back, fakes a pitchout to \n               Spearchucker, who is racing toward the line, and continues \n               backward, holding himself as if he still had the ball and \n               were fading for a long pass. So successfully does he create \n               this impression that the two tackles from Cleveland, seeing \n               clearly that Spearchucker hasn't received the ball, descend \n               on Trapper with their last burst of energy. Two other orange-\n               and-black linemen also fall on top of him. Meanwhile, Vollmer, \n               holding his arms crossed under his stomach to further hide \n               the ball, and looking as if her were suffering from a painful \n               blow beneath the belt, starts walking down the field at an \n               angle toward his own sideline, making the opposition think \n               he is heading for the bench to seek relief from his injury.\n\n               Spearchucker stops running at about the enemy thirty, looks \n               back to where Trapper's tacklers are beginning to remove \n               themselves, but also notes out of the corner of his eye that \n               only the opposing safety man is anywhere near Vollmer and \n               that he isn't paying much attention to him.\n\n               From the bench a frantic Henry looks indignantly at the sight \n               of his center and Sergeant Major coming off the field.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         What's going on?
