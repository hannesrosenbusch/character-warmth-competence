DOC'S CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT 114\n\nDoc driving on the freeway. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\n Shasta is curled up in the\npassenger seat. A fog is rolling in on the Santa Monica\nFreeway. Headlights drift ahead and behind him...\n\nSHASTA\nRemember that day, the Ouija board\nset us off into that big storm?\n\nDOC\nOne of a couple things I never\nforgot -- don't know why.\n\nSHASTA\nThis feels the same way, tonight.\nJust us. Together. Almost like\nbeing underwater. The world,\neverything gone someplace else.\n\nDOC\nFigured it was Sortilege just\nsettin' us up.\n\nSHASTA\nNo, she...\n\nDOC\nHer Ouija board...\n\f127.\n\nSHASTA\nShe knows things, Doc... maybe\nabout us that we don't know...\nDOC\nThis don't mean we're back\ntogether.\nSHASTA\n\nCourse not.\nShe drifts -- off to sleep.\n\nSORTILEGE (V.O.)\nDoc fell into a car convoy, moving\nslowly, single lane through the\nfog. He figured if he missed the\nGordita Beach exit, he'd take the\nfirst one whose sign he could read\nand work his way back on surface\nstreets. He knew that at\nRosecrans, the freeway began to\ndogleg east, and at some point,\nHawthorne Boulevard or Artesia,\nhe'd lose the fog, unless it was\nspreading tonight, and settled in\nregion wide... Maybe then it would\nstay this way for days, maybe he'd\nhave to just keep driving, down\npast Long Beach, down through\nOrange County, and San Diego and\nacross a border where nobody could\ntell anymore in the fog who was\nMexican, who was Anglo, who was\nanybody. Then again, he might run\nout of gas before that happened,\nand have to leave the caravan, and\npull over on the shoulder, and\nwait. For whatever would happen.\nFor a forgotten joint to\nmaterialize in his pocket. For the\nCHP to come by and choose not to\nhassle him. For a restless blonde\nin a Stingray to stop and offer him\na ride. For the fog to burn off,\nand for something else this time,\nsomehow, to be there instead.\n\nFADE OUT.",
