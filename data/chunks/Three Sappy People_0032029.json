I'm sorry, Madame.\n\nThe Countess walks off with disdain. The butler shoots a glance across the \nroom. We follow his gaze with a FAST PAN TO the man of the house MR.

  "22": "---END OF PREVIOUS SECTION---\nWILLIAMS\n\t\tDoctor York just--\n\nWilliams gets hit by a cream puff. Huffily, he turns to exit and gets a cold \none right in the back of the neck. He raises his shoulders high, exhales \ndeeply, and marches out of the room. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\nRumsford and the Stooges crawl on hands and knees away from the rioting \npartygoers and confer in a quieter part of the room. \n \n\t\t\t\tRUMSFORD\n\t\t\t(to the Stooges)\n\t\tGentlemen, I think you'd better leave now while \n\t\tmy wife's still enjoying herself and before she \n\t\tchanges her mind. Believe me, I'm grateful. \n\t\t\t(pulls out a wad of cash)\n\t\tWill-will about fifteen hundred do?\n\n\t\t\t\tMOE\n\t\t\t(taking the whole wad)\n\t\tOh, that's just right. Thanks.\n\nRumsford crawls away to join Sherry while the Stooges count their money.\nSherry is having a ball, throwing and being thrown at.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHERRY\n\t\tWhoooo!  Ha ha ha!\n\nA smiling Rumsford approaches, carrying a huge chocolate cake that says HAPPY \nBIRTHDAY on it.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHERRY\n\t\t\t(happily, off the cake)\n\t\tOh, my birthday cake! Oh, darling, in all my \n\t\tlife I've never had so much fun!\n\nRumsford immediately DUMPS the entire cake on her head.\n\n\t\t\t\tRUMSFORD\n\t\tMe, too.\n\nThey stare at each other, she in disbelief and he, inscrutably, with his \nhands on his hips.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE OUT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page hosted by    Get your own Free Home Page \n  \n"
