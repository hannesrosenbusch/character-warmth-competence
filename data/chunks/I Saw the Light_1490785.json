Sometime past midnight. Some\ntime around 1950. And though it’s impossible to clearly make\nout details, it feels like what it is, a sweaty HONKY TONK.\n\nCamera floats like a moth around the beautiful and hypnotic\nface; past the dark haunted eyes of a 27 year-old man who\nsomehow even in this first moment feels like he's at least 20\nyears older. HIRAM “HANK” WILLIAMS born in a speck of a town,\npoorer than is imaginable.\n\nGlimpses of his ever present cowboy hat. A small stately\nStetson. His fancy western suit, sweat stained collar and\nmissing rhinestones. Not because he can’t afford to fix them,\nhe just doesn't have the time. Hank is burning through the\ndays and nights with a fever that will scorch you.\n\nThe voice is confident and ancient and yet supple like a\nchild. But mostly it is so damn personal that every person\nwho hears it thinks it belongs to them. And of course, it is\nsad. Sadder than anyone has ever heard. The song is “Cold\nCold Heart.”\n\nHANK\n“In anger unkind words are said,\nthat make the tear drops start\nHow can I free your doubtful mind\nand melt your cold cold heart...”\n\nThe strains of Hank’s lament play under the opening of the\nnext scene and then as speaking voices come up, it dies out.\n\n73 MILES SOUTH OF MONTGOMERY\nANDALUSIA, ALABAMA DECEMBER 15,1944\n\nEXT.
