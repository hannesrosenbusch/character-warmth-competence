SPORTSMAN'S LODGE - SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - DAY\n\n               A large crowd has gathered to watch two WHITE BOXERS square \n               off in a temporary ring in the center of a converted banquet \n               hall. One is BOBBY, the other is RICKY. They are drawn \n               together to start the bout by a bell and a hand gesture as \n               the REFEREE backs away. Immediately the two fighters unload \n               a relentless barrage of POWER PUNCHES. Neither man is holding \n               back, and the punches all find purchase in the swelling faces \n               of their opponent. The crowd rises to its feet in appreciation \n               of this rare level of competition in the lower strata of the \n               heavyweight division.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT.

Both their faces are swollen, verging on \n               the grotesque. Bobby drives a black Special Edition 1979 \n               Trans Am with the gold Firebird stenciled across the hood.  \n               The car is not in great shape, but in its day ruled the road. \n               A Hawaiian mini warrior mask hangs from the rear view.\n\n               The T-top is out, and Ricky struggles to light his cigarette \n               in the wind. He finally ignites the whole book of matches in \n               frustration, lights up, then tosses it out.\n\n               It lands, still flaming, at the base of a 'No Smoking in the \n               Canyon' sign. They drive down the palm tree lined stretch of \n               road bordering Beverly Hills. They turn East on Sunset \n               Boulevard.
