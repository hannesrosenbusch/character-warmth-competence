Twin beams\n\nof light comes from what look to be... eyes, in an enormous\nface. A giant?! Made of metal!\n\nTHUNDER BOOMS. The impossible face seems to turn\ndownward... and looks at the men.

The General looks at his men.\n\nGENERAL\nLet's go home.\n\nThe General carries Hogarth to the Jeep. Hogarth stares at\nthe GREEN LEAF in his hand. We CLOSE ON on the leaf and...\n\nMATCH CUT TO:\n\f91.\n\nTHE SAME LEAF\nIt is now brown. We pull out to reveal that we're in...\n\nHOGARTH'S BEDROOM\nWhere the leaf sits on Hogarth's\nbookshelf beside the picture of his\nfather. We pan out the window to\nRockwell itself. It's springtime.\nAnd everything old is new again.\n\nEXT. ROCKWELL STREETS - DAY\nDean and Annie walk hand in hand with Hogarth alongside.\nEveryone smiles and waves. All three are now celebrities,\nand even Dean seems well-liked and respected.\nThe busybodies spot the trio, and whisper to each other.\nMYRTLE\nWhy, don't they make a lovely\nfamily!\n\nDean and Annie exchange a smile. This time Hogarth smiles\nand nods, too. Then something on the ground catches his eye:\n\nA scorched piece of iron.\n\nHogarth picks it up, examines it, a bittersweet expression\non his face. Hogarth carefully puts the piece in his\npocket, and looks up into the sky....\n\nEXT. NORTHERN INDIA - NIGHT\n\nA lonely kid from India, SASHI, a tinkerer, sits in his room\nworking on an electronics project. It's a poor but well-\nkept home. Out a window, a METEOR plows into their field:\nKABOOM!\n\nTHE METEOR CRATER\n\nRopes lead down into the crater; PULL BACK TO REVEAL Sashi\nhas an elephant pulling out the meteor.\n\nSASHI\nPull!\n\nThe elephant strains, pulls: it's the head of the Giant.",
  "62": "END OF PREVIOUSLY ANNOTATED SECTION:\nTHE METEOR CRATER\n\nRopes lead down into the crater; PULL BACK TO REVEAL Sashi\nhas an elephant pulling out the meteor. SASHI\nPull! The elephant strains, pulls: it's the head of the Giant. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\nThe boy leaps into the air, shouting, overjoyed.\n\nINT. A \"BARN\" IN INDIA - EVENING\n\nIn an India-version of Hogarth's barn, Sashi cleans the\ngiant head. But it looks dead.\n\f92.\n\nINDIA MOTHER\nShashi! Dinner!\n\nSHASI\nComing!\nSashi walks out... then CRACKLE! Lights flicker in the\nGiant's eyes... and the eyes light up.\n\nThe Giant looks around, comes to his senses, sees his\npredicament... and the antenna rises up out of his head.\n\nANGLES: ALL OVER THE WORLD\n\n--giant parts, wherever they've fallen, suddenly snap to\nattention.\n\nSeveral NUTS and BOLTS dig themselves up out of sand. The\npieces start hopping away.\n\nPart of a FINGER surfaces in the sea and WORMS toward shore.\n\nA sign by an ocean liner reads \"India\". Several parts sneak\nup the gangplank.\n\nINT. HOGARTH'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nHogarth is awakened by a RATTLING SOUND. He looks to see the\nscorched PIECE OF IRON on his dresser as it drops to the\nfloor and starts moving toward his window. Hogarth BEAMS...\n...and opens his window to release it. MUSIC SOARS as the\nboy watches the piece of metal GO, his mind swimming with\nnew possibilities.\n\nABOVE THE PLANET\n\nThe Giant's scorched HAND orbits listlessly. Suddenly it\nWAKENS... and slowly turns away from us. Burning as it hits\nthe atmosphere, the hand reaches toward earth...\n\nFADE EVERYTHING TO BLACK... except the tiny flaming dot...\n\nTHE END\n\f"
