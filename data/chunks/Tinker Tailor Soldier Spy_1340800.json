Then, as we\n\n    begin to PULL BACK, we hear a faint whine, increasing in\n\n    volume, until it's the roar of two MiG jet fighters,\n\n    cutting across the skyline. The PULL BACK reveals a YOUNG\n\n    BOY watching the jets, exclaiming excitedly in Hungarian.\n\n\n\n\n\n2   EXT. BUDAPEST STREET - DAY                                    2\n\n\n\n    LATERALLY TRACKING down a bustling street, as the jets\n\n    scream by overhead. Pedestrians look up. All except one man\n\n    who continues walking. This is JIM PRIDEAUX.\n\n\n\n    ACROSS THE STREET: More pedestrians. We're not sure who\n\n    we're supposed to be looking at - the short stocky man? The\n\n    girl in the mini skirt? The man in the checked jacket?\n\n\n\n    A car driving beside Prideaux accelerates out of the frame.\n\n    Across the street the girl in the mini-skirt peels off into\n\n    a shop. The stocky man turns and waves to us. But it isn't\n\n    Prideaux he's greeting but another passerby, who walks\n\n    over, shakes hands.\n\n\n\n    Now we're left with Prideaux and the Magyar in the checked\n\n    shirt, neither paying any attention to each other.\n\n\n\n    Just as we are wondering if there is any connection, the\n\n    two reach a corner and the Magyar, pausing to cross the\n\n    road, collides with another passerby. He looks over and\n\n    sees Prideaux has caught the moment of slight clumsiness\n\n    and gives the smallest of rueful smiles. A tiny moment of\n\n    contact between the two. Then both men walk on around the\n\n    corner, just two strangers headed in the same direction...\n\n\n\n\n\n3   EXT.

A CAFE\n\n    occupies the middle space under the high vaulted ceiling. A\n\n    JAZZ ROCK band rehearses in one of the nearby disused\n\n    shops, incongruous in the window, music muffled by the\n\n    glass. Customers sit around tables playing chess, drinking\n\n    coffee, a mother breast-feeding, the hum of chatter.

Prideaux smiles, draws   on his\n\ncigarette, nonchalantly examining the people   at the tables\n\naround them. A WAITER arrives, belly bulging   out of his\n\ngrubby shirt, hair plastered to his head. He   puts two\n\nwizened-looking sandwiches in front of them.\n\n\n\nPRIDEAUX'S P.O.V. - A DROP OF SWEAT trickles from the\n\nWaiter's face, drips onto the table top.\n\n\n\nThe Magyar catches Jim looking at the droplet and gives a\n\nwry smile - \"nice service.\" Jim smiles back but a bell has\n\nbegun to ring inside him.\n\n\n\n                    JIM PRIDEAUX\n\n          When do I get to meet your\n\n          friend?\n\n\n\nThe Magyar chews on his sandwich, notices Prideaux is\n\nignoring his.\n\n\n\n                    MAGYAR\n\n          I'll take you to him.",

Behind\n\nhim his chair teeters for a moment, then slowly falls back\n\nand lands with a CRASH, sending pigeons fluttering up to\n\nthe domed ceiling.\n\n\n\nThe WAITER starts, turns, sees Prideaux leaving. Panic\n\nflashes across his face, he draws a GUN from the back of\n\nhis belt, aims after Prideaux and FIRES - the shot echoing\n\nin the cavernous space.\n\n\n\nThe shot misses, RICOCHETING off the tiled wall and\n\nPrideaux keeps walking, fighting down the impulse to run,\n\nas behind him, out of focus - an image from a surreal\n\nNIGHTMARE: the other CUSTOMERS stop what they are doing,\n\nlike actors at the end of a scene, and begin to rise, some\n\ndrawing guns.

The wind catches at his cape and it flutters to one\n\n     side, revealing the sweat-soaked shirt beneath. As we watch\n\n     a DARK STAIN appears at his shoulder blade and begins to\n\n     spread. It's BLOOD.\n\n\n\n\n\n67   EXT.

He gives him a yellow slip for the bag.\n\n\n\nGuillam climbs inside and begins to ascend, rattlingly\n\nslowly.

He wipes his hands. For the\n\nfirst time we realize how NERVOUS he is.\n\n\n\nPolished shoes appear as they reach the floor, then the\n\nuniform trousers of a short man. A self-important JANITOR.\n\n\n\nGuillam steps out and the Janitor checks Guillam's pink and\n\nyellow chit and motions him through a turnstile. Then he\n\nstops him short. He gestures for Guillam to raise his arms.\n\n\n\n                    PETER GUILLAM\n\n          You're kidding?\n\n\n\n                       JANITOR PETE\n\n          New rules.\n\n\n\nGuillam is briskly frisked.\n\n\n\n                    PETER GUILLAM\n\n          Mind the jewels.\n\n\n\n                    JANITOR PETE\n\n          Pen and watch sir.\n\n\n\nHe holds up a box and Guillam hands him his fountain pen\n\nand watch.\n\n\n\nThe search over Guillam sets off down the corridor,\n\nunnerved by the task ahead - betraying his own kind.\n\n\n\n                    BILL HAYDON (O.S.",
