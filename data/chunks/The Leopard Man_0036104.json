A jet of waiter rises into the\n\n               air at regular intervals, tossing an empty ball in rhythm.\n\n               Below the ball, the water cascades into the second tier of\n\n               the fountain. SUPERIMPOSED over this fountain are the main\n\n               and credit titles. Throughout the running of the titles we\n\n               hear castanet music growing louder and louder. When the last\n\n               credit title FADE OFF we begin to\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                       DISSOLVE\n\n\n\n\n\n               The corridor, backstage at El Pueblo. An empty corridor\n\n               stretches away before us. The CAMERA TRUCKS ALONG this\n\n               corridor. The sound of the castanets is so loud and ringing\n\n               now that it has a furious and stormlike quality. The camera\n\n               seems to search for the source of this sound. It approaches\n\n               two open doorways at the end of the corridor.\n\n\n\n\n\n               Through the doorway on the right we see a dancer in Spanish\n\n               costume. She pirouettes in a final whirl of the dance as the\n\n               CAMERA MOVES IN TO a CLOSE SHOT of her beautiful back and the\n\n               two castanets she holds up over her gleaming naked shoulders.\n\n               Over the diminishing trill of the castanets, as the dancer\n\n               finishes her dance we hear a dull and angry pounding. The\n\n               castanets click to an end.\n\n\n\n\n\n               The CAMERA MOVES LEFT to take in the adjoining door to show\n\n               us the source of this sound.\n\n\n\n\n\n               INT. KIKI WALKER'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n\n\n\n\n               Kiki Walker as she finishes pounding on the wall for silence\n\n               in the adjoining dressing room and turns back into her own\n\n               room. She is young, blonde and represents that peculiar\n\n               phenomenon of our time, the chorus girl and entertainer who\n\n               is more lady-like than the majority of Junior Leaguers. Road\n\n               shows, one night stands and even a short turn in burlesque\n\n               have left no battle scars. She may know many a hard word, but\n\n               she never uses it.\n\n\n\n               MED. SHOT - Kiki's room. Kiki slams shut the door of her\n\n               dressing room.",

Through the doorway comes the black,\n\n               spade-shaped head of a panther, ears wickedly flat, muzzle to\n\n               the floor.

The adobe walls are\n\n               plastered with pictures of religious subjects.\n\n               The wooden floor is bare. There is a charcoal-burning brasero\n\n               in one corner. Pots and pans on the hearth of the fireplace\n\n               show that it is a supplementary stove, The rest of the\n\n               furniture consists of an iron bedstead, a large and hideous\n\n               oak table and an open-faced china cabinet which contains the\n\n               Delgado treasures.\n\n\n\n               Pedro, Teresa's nine-year-old brother is seated at the oak\n\n               table, eating from a bowl of frijoles.

STREET OUTSIDE DELGADO HOUSE - NIGHT \n\n\n\n               Teresa steps down from the single doorstep outside her house.\n\n               She crosses her arms and pulls her shoulders together in a\n\n               gesture of fear. She looks once, despairingly, at the closed\n\n               door behind her  and then reluctantly steps out into the\n\n               dirt road and starts walking.\n\n\n\n               EXT. CALDERON GROCERY - NIGHT\n\n\n\n               Only a large corner window, with the word. \"Provisiones\"\n\n               printed on it shows that this ordinary house is a grocery\n\n               store. In the moonlight, one can see a few boxes of groceries\n\n               stacked on shelves inside. Teresa comes up to the window and\n\n               peers in. She knocks on the window.\n\n\n\n                                   TERESA\n\n                         Senora Calderon It is Teresa,\n\n                         Senor. Teresa Delgado.\n\n\n\n               Over Teresa's shoulder, we see the interior of the little\n\n               store light up dimly as a curtain is pulled at the back of\n\n               the room. Beyond the curtain is revealed another room,\n\n               brightly lit by a bare electric globe hanging from the\n\n               ceiling on a cord. Under the light, a man sits at a table,\n\n               heartily eating from a plate heaped with food. The curtain\n\n               has been pulled back by Senora Calderon. We see her only in\n\n               silhouette and the details of her face and figure are\n\n               indistinguishable. We do see, however, that her long black\n\n               hair is down her back and she is braiding it.

EDGE OF ARROYO - NIGHT\n\n\n\n               The Arroyo is a deep narrow cut in the mesa, bonedry in this\n\n               season. Its floor of bleached sand and weeds stretches\n\n               desolately wider a vast moonlit sky.

To divert the rush of rain\n\n               water in winter and spring, the bridge is underpropped by two\n\n               slanting stone piers.

Teresa enters slowly. She takes a few steps\n\n               toward the blackness - and stops. She listens. Teresa moves\n\n               forward again, walking as lightly as possible. The light dims\n\n               rapidly, so that after Teresa has taken a half dozen steps,\n\n               she is swallowed up in complete blackness.\n\n\n\n               The CAMERA HOLDS for a moment on the dark underpass before\n\n               Teresa emerges from the blackness on the West side. A light\n\n               scratching sound is heard. Teresa's eyes widen in panic as\n\n               she hears it and she hurries out of the tunnel, watching\n\n               fearfully ever her left shoulder. She must cut across in\n\n               front of this other tunnel in order to get to the south bank.\n\n               She starts across, never taking her eyes off the black tunnel\n\n               mouth. Suddenly she gives a convulsive start and a little cry\n\n               escapes before she can control it. A shadowy shape, low to\n\n               the ground, detaches itself from the dimness of the tunnel\n\n               opening and moves toward her. Almost at once, we see that it\n\n               is a large tumbleweed, blowing clown the Arroyo in the wind.\n\n               Teresa sighs soundlessly and goes on to the foot of the bank.\n\n               She starts scrambling up another steep little path.\n\n\n\n                                                       DISSOLVE\n\n\n\n               INT.",

This is her eighteenth birthday.\n\n\n\n               Senora Contreras walks to the foot of the bed and stands\n\n               looking down at her daughter. She smiles sadly. In still,\n\n               untroubled sleep, the full vulnerability of Consuelo's youth\n\n               is touchingly apparent.\n\n\n\n               Marta stands to one side, a little behind Senora Contreras.\n\n               Cousin Felipe remains in the background, near the open door.\n\n               Rosita tiptoes cautiously to the head of the bed and\n\n               carefully puts down the roses, so that the blossoms lie in\n\n               the curve of Consuelo's outflung arm. She has to drop on one\n\n               knee to do this and she stays in this position, slowly\n\n               drawing her hands away from the flowers.

Now, we hear the sound\n\n               more distinctly  as she is hearing it  but it is still a\n\n               light, feathery sound. Then, suddenly, it ceases.

Just before he gets to the corner, a lighted\n\n               cigarette spins out and falls to the pavement in front of\n\n               him.\tGalbraith stops as if he had come up against stone.\tHe\n\n               stands there, forcing courage to go on. He takes the few\n\n               steps to the corner and faces the direction from which the\n\n               cigarette was thrown. There is on one in sight anywhere.\n\n\n\n               Very slowly, Galbraith reaches down and picks up the\n\n               cigarette. The unlighted end is dark with lipstick. With an\n\n               almost imperceptible shudder, Galbraith lets the cigarette\n\n               fall. Walking rigidly, he continues on his way.\n\n\n\n               INT. MUSEUM - NIGHT\n\n\n\n               The large room is in shadowy darkness. The heavy front door\n\n               swings open. Suddenly the place is brilliantly lighted from\n\n               the overhead fixtures. Galbraith takes his hand from the\n\n               light-switch just inside the door. He pushes the clear closed\n\n               and leans up against it exhaustedly. He is breathing heavily\n\n               and his eyes are dull and heavy-lidded with the reaction from\n\n               violent fear.\n\n\n\n               He sighs deeply and then walks slowly and wearily across the\n\n               display room to the office alcove. He sits down at his\n\n               worktable and starts work on a small model of Indian ruins,\n\n               done in colored clays.\n\n\n\n               Suddenly, far away but clear in the silence, he hears the\n\n               sound of castanets  just three widely spaced clicks. His\n\n               hands becomes motionless above the model -but he does not\n\n               look up.\n\n\n\n               The same sound comes again, repeated twice, the clicks a\n\n               little more rapid.\n\n\n\n               Galbraith gets to his feet and stands staring into the empty,\n\n               brilliantly lighted museum room.",

He takes a handkerchief from his pocket and slowly\n\n               wipes his face and his bands.\n\n\n\n               Re steps out of the alcove and presses a lightswitch on the\n\n               wall nearby.
