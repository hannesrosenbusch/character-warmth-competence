MADAME’S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY 135\n\n \n\nThe inside of the house is dark, and MADAME doesn’t switch\non the lights.\n\nMADAME ushers TOMMY and KATHY into the living room, then\ndissapears.\n\nThe living room was once two rooms, with the partition wall\nremoved, now replaced by a sliding screen.\n\nThe interior is lit by what light filters through the net\ncurtains.\n\fSHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p93.\n\nIt reveals a Victorian living room, with period furniture,\nand a feeling of dust and age.\n\nOn one wall are two agit-prop posters, in support of the\nHailsham movement.\n\nOpposite, a large watercolour of Hailsham is hung above the\nfireplace.\n\nTOMMY\nLook.\n\nHe indicates the watercolour to KATHY.\nThey talk quietly.\n\nTOMMY (CONT'D)\nIt’s Hailsham. It’s the bit\naround the back of the pond.\n\nKATHY\nWhat do you mean? There’s no\npond here.\n\nTOMMY\nNo, the pond’s behind you.\n\nKATHY seems slightly taken aback by the irritation in\nTOMMY'’S voice.\n\nTOMMY (CONT'D)\nYou must be able to remember.

Then the\nsliding screen is pulled back...\n\n... but apparently for no purpose. The rear half of the\nliving room - beyond what was once the partition wall - is\nalmost completely in shadow.\n\nWith the screen fully pulled back, MADAME enters the lit\narea of the room, and indicates that they should sit.\n\nMADAME takes a seat in an armchair beside the fireplace,\nand KATHY and TOMMY sit on the sofa opposite.\n\nAs they get comfortable, there is a soft mechanical\nwhirring sound from the dark half of the living room, which\nKATHY is distracted by.\n\nThen brought back to focus by MADAME.\n\fSHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH pod.\n\nMADAME\nSo.\n\nLong beat.\nThen:\n\nTOMMY\nWe’re in love.\n\nTOMMY turns to KATHY.

I didn’t\nreally do any art, so you never\n\ntook anything. I know that’s my\nfault, and it’s probably much too\nlate...\n\nHe reaches down and opens his bag.\n\nTOMMY (CONT'D)\n+. but I brought some things\nwith me now.\n\nHe starts to lay the drawings out on the floor for MADAME\nto see.\n\fSHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH pos.\n\nTOMMY (CONT'D)\nSome were done quite recently,\nbut a lot of them are several\nyears old, so there’s a spread.\nAnd you should have Kath’s stuff\nalready.",
