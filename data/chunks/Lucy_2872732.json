In\nanyone you meet?\n\nLucy\nNo, but I'm getting better. Every\ndoor that opens releases knowledge\nthat allows me to open the next one.\n\nPROFESSOR NORMAN\n(remembers the lesson)\nLike dominoes.\n\nPROFESSOR #2\nAnd... What stage are you at now?\n\nLucy\nI can control matter... Ona small\nscale.\n\nLucy makes a sculpture on the table rise and hover in front of\n“her. The sculpture begins to change, morphing into all kinds of\nweird and wonderful shapes.\n\nPROFESSOR NORMAN\n(to himself)\nBreathtaking!\n\nLucy\nYes, but I have to devote a lot of\nmy energy to slowing it all down.\n\nPROFESSOR NORMAN\nWhy slow it down?\n\f| Lucy\nTo protect the humanity within me.\nOtherwise, I wouldn't be able to\ncommunicate with you anymore, just\nlike you can no longer communicate\nwith plants or animals.

Because\none plus one has never made two.\nThere are in fact no numbers and no\nletters. All that's just prehistoric\ngrunting.

It's\nworking on a titanic construction\nsite that it manipulates without\nmoving, without even existing.\nDevoid of fear.

They form a gigantic web\nof communication, which in turn\nforms matter. Cells group together,\ntaking one form, deforming,\nreforming... makes no difference.\nHumans consider themselves\n“unique,” so they have rooted the\nwhole theory of their existence in\nthis uniqueness. Their whole world\nand their mathematical languages\nare a function of themselves. \"One\"\nis their unit of measure. But it's\nnot.
