Kevin stays on his feet but\nTHE FENCE\n\nsplinters with each blow until finally, with the last punch, it\ngives way. The boys go tumbling over the side of the cliff.\n\nCLAIRE\nNo!\n\nClaire dashes to the cliff'’s edge and peers down into the black\nabyss. She can make out only the vague contours of a NARROW\nOUTCROPPING OF ROCK about fifteen feet below.\n\f103.\n\nCLAIRE\nKevin?\nKEVIN (0.S.)\n(parely audible)\nMom ...\nCLAIRE\nHang on!\n\nClaire finds Noah’s knife and cuts the rope of the tire swing\nwith it.

She ties one end to a tree and sends the other end\nover the cliff. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\nCLAIRE\nCan you reach the rope?\n\nAfter a moment, there’s a tug.\n\nCLAIRE\nGood. Now climb up.\n\nShe sits on the ground and coils the rope around her hands.\nKevin’s weight is almost too much for her, but she holds on\nfast, taking up the slack whenever she can.\n\nAfter a few moments, she sees his hand reach up over the\nedge. Claire grabs his wrist and pulls him up.\n\nAs the top of his head emerges from the darkness, he lets out\na small GRUNT OF EXERTION.\n\nClaire stops cold, unnerved.\n\n/ CLAIRE\nKevin?\n\nHe turns his blood-covered face up to her. And it’s not\nKevin’s eyes she’s looking into.\n\nIT’S NOAH.\n\nClaire recoils and releases his wrist.\n\nAs Noah slides over the edge, he grabs Claire’s foot, dragging\nher with him. She snags the rope just before going over.\n\nOVER THE SIDE OF THE CLIFF\n\nClaire dangles from the rope with Noah clinging to her. She\nsquirms and kicks, but he’s attached to her like a leech.\n\nAfter a moment, he begins a slow and steady climb up the\nlength of Claire’s bo ly. His fingers rip her clothes, dig\ninto her flesh. Her grip grows weaker by the second.\n\nCLAIRE\nI can't hold on.\n\nHe presses his lips to her ear, hissing.\n\nNOAH\nGo ahead. Let go.\n\f104.\n\nBut she doesn’t. And he hoists himself up to solid ground.\n\nNoah crouches down and extends his hand to her. Claire\nstares up at him defiantly.\n\nNOAH\nI’d never do anything to hurt you,\nClaire.\nClaire’s HANDS SLIP.\n\nNOAH\nYou can trust me.\n\nHis face is as innocent as a choirboy’s.\n\nClaire hesitates, then reaches out and grasps his hand. She\ngives a hint of a smile before her grip tightens.\n\nCLAIRE\nBut you can’t trust me.\n\nNOAH’S EYES\nwiden with surprise as Claire yanks him over the cliff.\n\nHe lets out a BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM as his body bounces off\nthe outcropping of rocks and plummets to the bottom of the\nravine.\n\nClaire hangs there, gasping for breath.",

Claire falls to her knees and wails\nwith despair. Then, suddenly there’s weak cry.\n\nKEVIN (0.S.)\nMom ....\n\nClaire sees the rope MOVING. She peers into the ravine and\nsees Kevin climbing up.\n\nWhen he nears the top, Claire reaches out for him.\n\nTHEIR HANDS clasp together, united.

PETERSON HOUSE - DAY\n\nA “SOLD” sign is staked on the snow-covered lawn.

She\nreads: “We hereby inform you that your teaching license has\nbeen permanently revoked.”\n\nClaire smiles sadly and folds up the letter. She glances up\nat the garage.\n\nINT. PETERSON GARAGE - DAY\n\nDark and dusty. The automatic garage door opens.\n\nClaire enters and looks around for anything she might have\nleft. She spots a small box containing dormant flower bulbs.\n\nGARY (0.S.)\n\nHoney?\nClaire looks up and sees Gary, a jagged scar visible on his shorn\nscalp, his movements stilted is if still nursing his wounds.\n\nGARY\nYou about ready to go?\n\nClaire goes to Gary. They wrap their arms around each other\nand walk to the car where Kevin waits.\n\nWe remain in the garage as the automatic door descends,\nleaving us in total darkness.\n\nFADE OUT.\n\nTHE END\n\f"
