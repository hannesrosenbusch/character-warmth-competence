OPERATING ROOM - DAY 1\n\nA tense surgery in progress. Meters flicker, instruments\nflash in the bright overhead light. In the midst of it all\nstands DR. DAVID RAVELL, 35. The master of his domain.\nRavell leans forward so a NURSE can mop the sweat from his\nbrow as he completes a last, delicate procedure. His co\nworkers sigh collectively with relief.\n\nDAVID\n(to Asst. Surgeon)\nClose her up, will you?\n\nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY 2\n\nDr. Ravell comes out of surgery, clearly exhausted. Without\nhis surgical mask he is ruggedly handsome. TWO NURSES\nfollow, attending him like a fighter fresh from the ring:\nCHLOE, 25, Raven-haired and striking, and JASMINE, 24, an\nexotic mix of African-American and Asian.\n\nBLAKE DANIELS, 58, the silver-haired Chief Surgeon, rushes up\nthe corridor. On his heels is DR. LONNIE WALSH, 33. Lonnie\nis also conspicuously handsome, but he'll always be second to\nDavid. In everything.\n\nThe look on Blake's face stops David in his tracks.\n\nBLAKE\nThere's been a train crash near Santa\nBarbara. They're flying an aortal trauma\nhere now. How can I ask you this,\n\fDavid...\nDavid rubs his eyes. Thinks about it.\n\nDAVID\nI can do it, Blake.\n\nHis bravery isn't lost on the two nurses, although Chloe\nexchanges a quick, covert glance with Lonnie.\n\nCHLOE\nIs he crazy, Jasmine? He's been on his\nfeet for fourteen hours.\n\nJASMINE\nChloe, it's been this way since Leslie\ndied.

But his WAITRESS,\nstanding a couple seats down from him, doesn't move. She's\ncompletely absorbed in watching the soap opera that plays on\ntwo battered, fuzzy TV sets.\n\nBETTY SIZEMORE, 30, has a wholesome attractiveness that\ncompetes with a bit too much makeup and a cheesy white\nwaitress uniform. TWO OTHER WAITRESSES attend to customers\nbehind her.\n\nThe younger of the two guys is involved in the soap opera.\nBut the older one, still wants coffee. He gestures toward\nBetty.\n\fOLDER MAN\nMiss?\n\nBetty leans forward, grabs the coffee pot and moves in front\nof him.
