FOREST - JUST BEFORE DAWN\n\n\n\nMail-clad HORSEMEN gallop headlong through the dark, bent\n\nlow over their saddles. A bestial scream is heard, and\n\nsuddenly a saddle is empty, the rider sprawled face down in\n\na pool of blood.\n\n\n\nAt the head of the band, COLWYN, a boy of twenty-two, raises\n\nhis shield to ward off an unseen assailant. We hear a\n\nhorrendous tearing sound, and Colwyn's father, TUROLD,\n\nriding beside him, looks over at the boy. Colwyn is unharmed\n\n- but his shield is deeply gouged, as if by a huge claw.\n\n\n\nEXT.
