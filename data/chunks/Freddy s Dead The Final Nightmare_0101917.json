He is sixteen, dirty blonde, his eyes visibly \n\n       moving under closed lids as he sits huddle under a blanket in \n\n       his window seat.  The lights are dim -- the shade on the \n\n       window closed -- a bead of sweat dribbles down his forehead.  \n\n       The HUMMING of the jet's engines vibrates through the cabin.\n\n\n\n       The boy's eyes snap open.\n\n\n\n       Jacob glances around nervously.  He looks like an escaped \n\n       convict who just accidentally walked into the Policemen's \n\n       Ball.  A GREYHAIRED MAN two seats away from him gives the \n\n       teenager a cursory glance, then goes back to his book.  Jacob \n\n       lays his head back and tries to relax.  The engines continue \n\n       to drone.\n\n\n\n       Until a new noise starts.  A WHOOSHING NOISE.\n\n\n\n       The sound is very faint.  But distinct from everything else.  \n\n       Jacob frowns.\n\n\n\n       The noise gets LOUDER.  Jacob's sure he's hearing it now.  He \n\n       looks at the Greyhaired Man.  The man catches his eye and the \n\n       two of them stare at each other for a heartbeat - then Jacob \n\n       turns away.  The Man returns to his book.  And Jacob \n\n       immediately turns back to him.\n\n\n\n                           JACOB\n\n                 Do you hear that?\n\n\n\n       The man gives him an annoyed look as the WHOOSHING gets \n\n       louder.\n\n\n\n                           GREYHAIRED MAN\n\n                 Hear what?\n\n\n\n                           JACOB\n\n                 That noise.\n\n\n\n                           GREYHAIRED MAN\n\n                 I don't hear anything.\n\n\n\n       The man turns back to the book as the sound gets even LOUDER -\n\n       - like it's coming closer.  Jacob squirms in his seat -- \n\n       sneaks a look at the man again.  How can he not hear that?  A \n\n       STEWARDESS walks by and Jacob catches her attention.\n\n\n\n                           JACOB\n\n                 Excuse me.\n\n\n\n                           STEWARDESS\n\n                 Yes?\n\n\n\n       The WHOOSHING is completely obvious now.

Something \n\n                 happened.  My mom suddenly wouldn't take \n\n                 it anymore.  Something made her say \n\n                 enough is enough.  She hit back.

She broke her neck.  \n\n                 And when y father saw what he'd done - he \n\n                 finally became human.

It's as if people moved in and out and instead of \n\n       changing the plates on the mailbox, they just whacked a new \n\n       one over the old.  Karen steps closer to the mailbox.\n\n\n\n       The little sign on the top reads WILLIAMS.  She touches it \n\n       with her finger and it drops off, the nails holding it on \n\n       rusted away to dust.  A new plate is revealed.  This one says \n\n       THOMPSON. Karen picks lightly at it, and it swings away.  The \n\n       name underneath makes Karen gasp.\n\n\n\n       It reads KRUEGER.\n\n\n\n       And there's still another one under that horrible name.  \n\n       Karen quickly hits the Krueger plate off.
