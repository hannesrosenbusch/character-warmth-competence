They are \n               all Negroes and nearly all are dressed in glaring white -- \n               the women in garments like camisoles, the men in pants which \n               reach about to their shins: splayed, bare feet. Some of the \n               faces bear the marks of heavy savage ornaments which have \n               been removed, or of tatooing and scarring rituals which have \n               been outlived -- torn nostrils, lips and ear lobes, a neck \n               curiously thin and weak from the enormously heavy metal bands \n               which used to surround it. Some of the children are naked or \n               near-naked. Nearly everybody dutifully shares open hymnals, \n               but it is obvious that few, if any, can read. The singing of \n               most of them is weirdly shy and inchoate -- a little like \n               that of a neighborhood audience when a group \"sing\" is imposed \n               upon them. But on certain high phrases a glad, rich, wet \n               soprano lifts out large and happy, very child-like; and a \n               big male voice bleats forth joyous, jazz-like improvements \n               on the tune, a little off-key. There are very few men present.",

There are very few men present. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n               We detail or bring into salience, bare feet slapping time \n               and an anklet shimmying; a very earnest young married couple \n               with the wedding ring prominent and an impressive phalanx of \n               children in tow; the owner of the happy soprano, a sweet, \n               contented, pre-moral face; the owner of the big male voice; \n               the inevitable rather effeminate man in every congregation \n               who loves religion because he loves Beauty. He is immensely \n               pleased that he knows all the words (the others just dab at \n               them): he sings them without any knowledge of their meaning: \n               they sound Hawaiian. Also, we SPOT a tremendously old, \n               wrinkled, bent-over woman, dressed in white like a good \n               Christian, but with a bone stuck through the septum of her \n               nose. She croaks, toothless, bleary-eyed.\n\n               These things must be disposed of by late in the first stanza, \n               which continues:\n\n               \"Open now the crystal fountain Whence the living waters flow, \n               Let the fiery, cloudy pillar Lead me all my journey through.\"\n\n               We close on the old dame with the bone singing --\n\n               \"...my journey through.\" o.s., on \"...fiery, cloudy pillar\", \n               a queer SOUND, steadily louder: the absurdly flatulent, \n               yammering syncopation of a rachitic steam motor. Eyes begin \n               to wander from hymnals: CUT IN Brother frowning and singing \n               harder trying to impose order; attention to the hymn begins \n               to fall apart a little; FOLLOW the white, veering eyes to \n               FRAME, through the open window.\n\n               LONG SHOT -- THE AFRICAN QUEEN\n\n               whose WHISTLE lets out a steamy whinny, then REPEATS it, \n               with great self-satisfaction. She is squat, flat-bottomed -- \n               thirty feet long. A tattered awning roofs in six feet of her \n               stern. Amidships stand her boiler and engine. A stumpy funnel \n               reaches up a little higher than the awning.\n\n               ON SECOND WHINNY,\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT -- ON HIS BOAT\n\n               He is in worn, rather befouled white clothes.",

He wears a ratty boater, \n               slantwise, against the sunlight. He is attended by two young \n               Negroes so tall, thin and gracile they suggest black macaroni. \n               One is proudly and busily puttering at the engine, which \n               requires a lot of attention: the other is fanning ALLNUTT, \n               who is feeling just fine. Allnutt speaks to the fanner in \n               Swahili. The young man without breaking the rhythm of his \n               fanning, licks out one long, boneless arm and alters the \n               lashed tiller; the Queen begins to swerve toward shore. o.s., \n               the hymn continues, all but drowned by motor noise.\n\n               LONG SHOT -- INT. CHAPEL\n\n               Rose pulls out all the stops, spreads her knees, and pumps \n               like mad in her effort to drown out the ENGINE SOUND. Brother \n               sweats and sings even harder, scowling, shaking his head. \n               The singing is fraying out half to hell; the congregation is \n               a solid black wall of wandering eyes; a few pious converts \n               frown or nudge at the less pious; a little group is coalescing \n               toward the window.\n\n               The hymn, meanwhile, continues:\n\n               \"Feed me with the heavenly manna in this barren wilderness, \n               Be my sword, my shield, my banner, be the Lord my \n               righteousness.\"\n\n               Rose's sense of artistic propriety is too much for her. To \n               keep things going, she ought to play loud, but on the next \n               line --\n\n               \"When I tread the verge of Jordan...\" she shuts down to the \n               vox humana and the tremolo and maintains that through --\n\n               \"Bid my anxious fears subside.\"\n\n               On this line, Allnutt appears and lounges against the front \n               door frame still drawing on his cigar. Rose lets everything \n               rip fortissimo on the closing lines:\n\n               \"Death of death, and hell's destruction land me safe on \n               Canaan's side.",

Instantly there is a hell of a \n               hullaballoo o.s., all in gibberish, against which the closing \n               words of the hymn compete stridently.\n\n               The less self-controlled of the flock are no longer singing, \n               and are craning their necks and rolling their eyes, but with \n               just enough Sunday-Schoolish discipline to stay in their \n               places. The more pious, with effort, keep their eyes where \n               they belong and SING all the harder. IN QUICK SHOTS, Brother \n               and Rose redouble their efforts. There is a final long-drawn \n               \"Aaaa-men,\" and it is clear this is the closing hymn of the \n               service. Brother closes his book and picks up his service-\n               book; Rose shuts and locks the box-organ and puts the key \n               (which is on two shoestrings) around her neck. Brother strides \n               with decorous alacrity down the middle aisle. Immediately \n               following him, the natives hurry from their benches.\n\n               SHOOTING PAST ALLNUTT -- THROUGH DOOR\n\n               on the cause of the hullaballoo -- a squabbling football \n               scrimmage of virtually nude male heathens, battling for the \n               cigar butt. In b.g., if permissible, a couple of equally \n               nude women; a thin, pot-bellied little boy dashing happily \n               toward the fight. Brother and the eager heads of white-clad \n               Christians come into the SHOT, BACK TO CAMERA, watching. One \n               of the heathen fights his way up from the heap with a yowl \n               of supremacy, filed teeth in a great grin, prancing and \n               holding high above them all the frantically busted cigar of \n               vaudeville; others leap after it.\n\n               REVERSE ANGLE\n\n               Allnutt, seeing the wrecked cigar, looks kind of bleak.

The room is so \n               shaded against heat it is gloomy. The silence, gloom and \n               heat are stifling. Rose is pouring the second of three cups \n               of tea; she pours the third. Brother is deep in the news of \n               a Mission paper. Allnutt sits oppressed by the silence, like \n               a child on his good behavior.

Rose finishes fixing her own tea, and helps herself to bread-\n               and-butter. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n She lifts her cup, not quite crooking her pinkie, \n               and sips. Allnutt still doesn't move; he is waiting for \n               Brother. Brother finishes and turns his page, and, without \n               shifting his eyes, finds his tea with a blind hand and blindly \n               drinks it and sets down the cup again. Allnutt, licensed, \n               takes a big bite of bread-and-butter and picks up his cup \n               and washes it down. By Rose's covered reaction, it is clear \n               that she has been taught never, never to do this, but that \n               she expects no better of such as Allnutt. Allnutt sighs wetly \n               and contentedly. This, too, is bad manners to Rose, but she \n               takes it in her stride.\n\n               They go on soberly eating bread-and-butter and drinking tea. \n               The only SOUNDS are those of china, sipping, chewing and \n               swallowing. Nobody looks at anyone else. Brother and Rose \n               are wholly, stiffly reposeful; they are used to this. Allnutt \n               begins to get a little squirmy, like a child in church. The \n               silence makes him visibly uneasy, but he tries not to show \n               his uneasiness.\n\n               All of a sudden, out of the silence, there is a SOUND like a \n               mandolin string being plucked. At first the sound is \n               unidentifiable, though instantly all three glance sharply \n               up, each at the other two, then away; in the next instant \n               they recognize what it is and each glances sharply, \n               incredulously, at the other two -- and then again, quickly \n               away; then Brother and Rose glance with full recognition at \n               Allnutt, at the instant that he knows the belly-growl is \n               his. At the moment of recognition, he glances down at his \n               middle with a look of embarrassed reproach. He glances up \n               quickly and slyly -- hopeful they've missed it -- to find \n               the eyes of both still fixed on him. The instant their eyes \n               meet they bounce apart like billiard balls, and fix on the \n               first neutral object they happen to hit. Then Allnutt looks \n               at them again: neither will look at him.",

Rose and Allnutt simultaneously \n               recognize what they are doing (Brother is pretending to read, \n               misses it, and goes ahead and drinks his), and both, at the \n               same moment, lower their cups to saucers with an almost \n               simultaneous clink. Both look away from each other. Brother \n               clears his throat rather loudly and turns a page. Rose and \n               Allnutt reach for their cups; Brother beats them to it. When \n               Brother has again put down his cup, Rose -- the tail of her \n               eye on Allnutt -- picks up her cup and drinks, her eyes \n               carefully empty above the cup. Allnutt has his cup again on \n               the way to his mouth when his insides give out with a growl \n               so long-drawn and terrible that Rose first flinches, then \n               makes a noise across it with her spoon, stirring her tea. \n               Brother tightens up like a fist, his first reflex being that \n               this loud one is a calculated piece of effrontery. Allnutt \n               just endures it, with a look of suffering stoicism. When it \n               is over there is a tense silence. Allnutt slowly, slyly looks \n               up at Brother; he is stone. He looks to Rose; she is gazing \n               far off into space. Allnutt is quite embarrassed, and knows \n               they are. He does his best to relieve his own embarrassment \n               and theirs.\n\n                                     ALLNUT\n                              (in a friendly, yet \n                              detached tone)\n                         Just listen to that stomick of mine.\n\n               There is a silence. By their almost invisible reaction, it \n               is clear that to just listen to that stomick of his, is the \n               last thing they want to do. Allnutt is a bit chilled by the \n               silence, but he tries again.\n\n                                     ALLNUT\n                         Way it sounds, you'd think I'd got \n                         an 'eye-ener inside me.\n\n               A silence.\n\n               Rose looks at Allnutt; their eyes meet; he attempts a friendly \n               smile. Her face goes stony with embarrassment and she looks \n               quickly away. So does he.",

After a little chewing, his jaws \n               slow; he is expecting another growl and listens intently; so \n               does Rose; none comes, After a little, Allnutt relaxes and \n               Rose relaxes at least to a state of armed truce.

Until they hear his bellowing, Brother's and \n               Rose's heads are still ANGLED AWAY from jungle -- not towards \n               river still, but idle and unfocused.

The ENGINE SOUND is near normal balance; Rose \n               distinctly relaxes, and sits down; Allnutt relaxes at his \n               tinkering, and finishes it off with a bit of a flourish. \n               (From the breaking of the branches, SHOOT FROM AMIDSHIPS, \n               sternward, on Rose past Allnutt.)\n\n               While he stands, back to Rose, finishing his tinkering, \n               Allnutt looks happy as a clam and thoroughly smug. \n               Everything's the way he wants it, now.

Late twilight; the boat is \n               moored near a bank. Rose is taking a swallow of steaming \n               tea; she lowers her cup.

The CAMERA meanwhile very slowly \n               withdraws upward. In the last we can clearly see of their \n               faces, they are quite possibly dead. As CAMERA RISES, we see \n               them at full length, as prostrated and flattened as grasses \n               pressed in a book; then, their static boat and the crawling \n               water; the CAMERA RISES among the overhanging mangrove \n               branches which obscure and trap them; and, as it rises, the \n               SCREEN slowly darkens.\n\n               The CAMERA STOPS RISING. The dead silence is broken by an \n               infinitesimal SOUND OF RUSTLING. By eye and ear, after a few \n               seconds, it becomes recognizable as the stillest, slenderest \n               kind of rain, splintering downward, very gradually increasing \n               in volume and in richness of SOUND as the darkness deepens, \n               to an immense, peaceful, steady, flooding downpour. The \n               darkness pales into full daylight and the downpour continues, \n               and through it we can dimly see the boat and the prostrate \n               bodies, and after perhaps ten seconds of the new daylight \n               (after maybe fifteen of darkness), the rain begins to abate \n               and the CAMERA BEGINS VERY SLOWLY TO DESCEND.\n\n               It gets down through the branches. The bodies are motionless; \n               so is the boat; but the slime on the water, though still \n               slow, moves with a distinct new kind of energy.\n\n               THE CAMERA STOPS DESCENDING.
