About\nanticipating your opponent’s moves\nand devising countermeasures. The\nwinner plots one step ahead of the\nopposition, and plays her trump card\njust after they play theirs.\n\nShe’s actually speaking to her attorney, DANIEL POSNER (40s),\nwho stands, frustrated, as that wasn’t the answer he wanted.\n\nPOSNER\nTell me you’re going to take this\nseriously when you’re in there.\n\nHe motions to the DOOR. An atmospheric BUZZ of anticipation\nemanates from behind it. Elizabeth is seated, unruffled.\n\nELIZABETH\nIt’s about making sure you surprise\nthem, and they don’t surprise you.\n\nPOSNER\nYou’re gonna say that?

A pause.\nThe first time we hear the full extent of the RUCKUS outside\nthe waiting room. Softly:\n\nPOSNER\nThis isn’t a joke. They want you\nbehind bars. You make one statement,\ncorrect one nefarious allegation,\nthat’s it. You waive your right to\nthe Fifth and you're compelled to\nanswer everything.

Good luck.\n\nShe does not shake.\n\nELIZABETH\nYou're on retainer, Mr. Posner, to\nremove luck from the equation.\n\nWith a subtle shake of the head, Posner turns and trudges out.\nThe pervasive BUZZ ratchets up the second the door is opened,\nand mutes once more as it closes.\n\nNow alone, Elizabeth EXHALES deeply, a valve abruptly\nunblocked. As if suddenly weak in the knees, she sits back\ndown. Stares into the middle distance; determination\nextingiushed from her eyes.\n\nShe snatches her Fendi handbag and rummages in it. Her hands\nnow tremble, nerves taking hold. She finds what she’s looking\nfor - a small TRINKET BOX.\n\fShe considers it for a moment, hands still fidgeting. Her eyes\nsnap shut. DEEP BREATHS to calm a racing heart.\n\nBreathe. Breathe... Breathe.\n\nDefinitively, she closes her palm on the box as those\ndetermined eyes blink back into existence.\n\nElizabeth steps to the desk and rockets the trinket box into\nthe trash can.",

Our audit puts\nthe cost of this trip at over\n$20,000.

If you’re implying I\nviolated the gift ban, you’re barking\nup the wrong tree. Sovereign states\nare exempt from the gift ban under\nChapter 2 of the House and Senate\nEthnics Manuals.\n\nCONGRESSMAN SPERLING\nYou sure the Kenyans paid for that\ntrip?

Is it not true that one of\nyour staff raised a concern, which\nyou hastily dismissed?\n\nELIZABETH\nI‘1l1 tell you what I told Franklin\nWalsh.

F&B conglomerates?\n\nELIZABETH\nTheir contributions made up one\nquarter of the total, yes.\n\nCONGRESSMAN SPERLING\nIs it not also true that, because the\nKenyans instructed you late on this,\nfunds from private entities were\nalready in the pooled account when\nthe Kenyans transferred their funds\nin?\n\nELIZABETH\nYes, I believe so.\n\nPosner looks crestfallen. He knows what this means. MEDIA BUZZ\nratchets up. They smell blood.\n\nCONGRESSMAN SPERLING\n\n(beat; nods)\nWell. We have ourselves a smoking\ngun.

First In, First Out.\nIt means that money paid into a joint\naccount first, is the first money to\nbe paid out of it when the account is\ndrawn upon. The effect of this, is\nthat the Kenyan Government didn’t\ncontribute one dime towards the\n$20,000 that was spent on Senator\nDavis’ trip. It was covered by the\nsixteen private entities who first\ncontributed to that account.
