For this week begins Her\nMajesty's Golden Jubilee. Her strength\nand goodness, her Christian\nprinciples, have walked in the light\nof God ever since her ascension to\nthe throne. From her heart has come\nan ever-increasing flow of virtue\nand moral blessing with which she\nhas endowed us, her loving subjects.\n\nAs the man speaks we BOOM BACK AND AROUND SLOWLY to discover\nourselves in All Souls Southwick Church, London. The man\nspeaking is the Bishop, talking from the pulpit, backed up\nby the well-appointed magnificence of the Anglican altar. WE\nPAN AROUND the congregation in the pews. For the most, they\nare the well-dressed and well-bred families of the period,\nlistening attentively.\n\nCLOSE SHOT - IN BACK - MAN AND WOMAN 1A\n\nThis is where the less well-to-do parishioners are seated. A\nrugged, but strange-looking man of middle-age is seated here\nwith his wife. She is watching him anxiously. He is listening\nintently to the sermon, his head cocked forward. Then he\n\nlooks away, passes his hand over his brow, and seems as though\nto rise - as he looks at the Bishop o.s.",
