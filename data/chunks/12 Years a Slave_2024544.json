TOWNHOUSE/STUDY - DAY 1\n\n\n\n\n\n           -EARLY APRIL, 1841-\n\n           We are close on a PAIR OF BLACK HANDS as they open A\n\n\n\n           FINELY WRAPPED PACKET OF VIOLIN STRINGS.\n\n\n\n           WE CUT TO the hands stringing a VIOLIN. It's not a high\n\n           end piece, but it is quite nice.\n\n\n\n           WE CUT TO a wide shot of the study. Sitting in a chair\n\n           with violin in hand is SOLOMON NORTHUP; a man in his late\n\n           twenties. Everything about Solomon, his mien and manner,\n\n           is distinguished. But he, too, seems a hardy individual.\n\n           Someone who has known manual labor in his time.\n\n\n\n           Solomon begins to lightly play his violin, as if testing\n\n           the strings, their tuning. Satisfied, Solomon begins to\n\n           play vigorously. As he does, we make a HARD CUT TO:\n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n           INT. HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - EVENING\n\n\n\n           We come in on a lively affair. A dinner party is being\n\n           thrown within the confines of a fairly stately house. In\n\n           attendance are EIGHT COUPLES. All are WHITE and all are\n\n           FAIRLY YOUNG, in their early twenties. The men and women\n\n           are dressed in very fine attire. We should get the sense\n\n           that for the most part they are people of means.\n\n\n\n           The furniture has been set aside in the living room. At\n\n           the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a\n\n           REEL.\n\n\n\n           The music they are dancing to is being played by Solomon,\n\n           having cut directly from the tune he was previously\n\n           playing. He plays with a light determination, and in no\n\n           way seems possessed with empty servitude.\n\n\n\n           Solomon concludes the reel, and the dancers break into\n\n           enthusiastic applause, which is followed by personal\n\n           thanks and congratulations from all. It should be clear\n\n           that despite their respective races there is much\n\n           admiration and appreciation for Solomon's abilities.\n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n           INT.

We\n\n           see also the Northup children: MARGARET who is eight, and\n\n           ALONZO who is five. They are handsome, and well groomed\n\n           kids. Anne straightens up the children. She finishes,\n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n                          (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n          2.\n\n\n\n                         3 CONTINUED: 3\n\n           she rises up and stands behind them, almost as if\n\n           preparing to pose for a portrait.\n\n           They all wait a moment, then Solomon enters the foyer.\n\n           He stands and looks admiringly at his family. ADMIRINGLY\n\n           stressed. It isn't that he doesn't have love for them,\n\n           he does as well. But in the moment, he truly admires his\n\n           greatest accomplishment: a family that is healthy and\n\n           well and provided for. He goes to his children, and\n\n           hands each a coin, then goes to Anne. Gives her a kiss\n\n           on the cheek. The children giggle at the sight.\n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n           EXT. STREET - DAY\n\n\n\n           Solomon and his family are out walking along the streets\n\n           and groves of Saratoga.\n\n\n\n           The streets are well populated this morning with many\n\n           people out strolling. Most are WHITE, but there are\n\n           BLACKS as well. They are FREED BLACKS who mingle fairly\n\n           easily - though not always completely - with the whites.\n\n           We see, too, a few BLACK SLAVES who travel with their\n\n           WHITE MASTERS. These pairings are largely from the south\n\n           and - despite the fact the blacks are slaves - they are\n\n           not physically downtrodden, not field hands. They are\n\n           well dressed and \"leading apparently an easy life\" -\n\n           comparatively speaking - as they trail their masters.\n\n\n\n           As they walk, Solomon and his family arrive to an\n\n           intersection well-worn and muddied from horse and cart\n\n           traffic. Solomon and his children easily jump across the\n\n           muck. Anne stands at the lip of the puddle, calls for\n\n           Solomon to help her across.\n\n\n\n                          ANNE\n\n           Solomon...\n\n           Solomon, turning back to his wife with a broad smile\n\n           waving her forward:\n\n\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           Come, Anne.

Anne\n\n           gives her husband a lightly stern look to which Solomon\n\n           replies.\n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n                          (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n          3.\n\n\n\n\n\n                          SOLOMON\n\n           I will catch you, Anne.\n\n\n\n                          (BEAT)\n\n           I will.\n\n           Again, lightly stern:\n\n\n\n                          ANNE\n\n           You will.\n\n\n\n           And with that Anne takes the leap. Solomon catches her,\n\n           swings her around grandly and sets her down lightly to\n\n           the delighted applause of the children. That done,\n\n           Solomon takes Anne's hand and leads her on.\n\n\n\n           As Solomon and his family make their way, among the\n\n           slaves on the street, we see one in particular; JASPER.\n\n           As he trails his MASTER he can't help but note Solomon\n\n           and his family as they enter A STORE. His intrigue of\n\n           this most handsome and harmonious group should be\n\n           obvious.\n\n\n\n           With his Master occupied, Jasper moves slyly toward the\n\n           STORE.

He finds himself in a nearly lightless\n\n           room about twelve feet square with walls of solid\n\n           masonry. There is a thick and well-locked door, a small\n\n           window covered with iron bars and a shutter. The only\n\n           furniture is a wood stool and an old fashioned, dirty box\n\n           stove. As Solomon rises he sees that his HANDS are\n\n           CUFFED - the chain running to a bolt in the ground - and\n\n           his LEGS IN IRONS. At first Solomon is incredulous. But\n\n           that emotion is replaced first by fury and then panic.\n\n           He begins to pull on the chains, fight against them. He\n\n           does so with increasing desperation. Solomon flails\n\n           about, the sounds of the steel chains whipping and\n\n           beating against the masonry. He grunts and screams\n\n           without regard as the cuffs and irons bite into his\n\n           flesh, but he cannot pull himself free.\n\n           After several minutes of intense effort, Solomon tires,\n\n           slows, then finally he collapses.

She\n\n           is the offspring of a \"Guinea nigger,\" brought over to\n\n           Cuba in a slave ship. She nearly brims with unconversant\n\n           sexuality.\n\n           MISTRESS EPPS, Epps's wife, is also present. She sits\n\n           with, holds quite lovingly, some SLAVE CHILDREN.

His feet, \n\n           heartbeat and breath almost deafening. He is desperate. \n\n           The violence of his advance abruptly stops, there is \n\n           silence. We see in a clearance a posse of patrollers, \n\n           preparing for a lynching of two young men. Solomon's \n\n           eyes meet theirs. The two men look back at Solomon with \n\n           a look of fear as one of the patrollers checks the noose \n\n           around their neck. Suddenly the bloodhounds start \n\n           barking and the patrollers turn in the direction of \n\n           Solomon.

CANE FIELDS - DAY\n\n\n\n\n\n           -NOVEMBER, 1846-\n\n           ABOUT THIRTY SLAVES are working the field. They are\n\n           divided into THREE GANGS. The first which draw the cane,\n\n           the next lay the cane in the drill, the last then hoe the\n\n           rows after.\n\n           Solomon is among a gang that draws and cuts, and he moves\n\n           with speed and skill. Certainly more so than he\n\n           displayed picking cotton.\n\n           Standing with his overseer, Judge Turner watches.\n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n                         121 121\n\n\n\n           INT.

For a few beats she avoids eye contact\n\n           with Solomon. She seems, like Solomon, to be\n\n           unaccustomed to her surroundings and horribly frightened\n\n           by them. Eventually her eyes meet Solomon's. She makes\n\n           no sound, but great apprehension spills from her eyes.\n\n           Whatever's next, whatever horror awaits, she can barely\n\n           stand to face.",

Solomon\n\n           tries to jerk his hand away, but ANNA HOLDS IT IN PLACE.\n\n           Manipulating Solomon's hand, she begins to massage her\n\n           breast. Solomon takes no real pleasure in the act -\n\n           really, neither does Anna. THERE SHOULD BE A TRUE SENSE\n\n\n\n           ANNA IS JUST SO VERY, VERY DESPERATE FOR HUMAN CONTACT,\n\n\n\n           FOR THE NEED TO FEEL ALIVE AND LIKE A PERSON RATHER THAN\n\n\n\n           AN ANIMAL THAT EMOTIONALLY SHE IS WILLING TO ENGAGE\n\n\n\n           SOLOMON.\n\n           The need quickly compounds. Anna presses her lips to\n\n           Solomon's. Eventually, SHE DIRECTS HIS HAND BENEATH HER\n\n           DRESS AND BETWEEN HER LEGS. Solomon, with slightly more\n\n           compassion than a guy making union wages, BEGINS TO\n\n           MANIPULATE ANNA WITH HIS HAND. The act remains more\n\n           perfunctory than passionate.\n\n           We can see Anna moving toward climax and eventual\n\n           release. But more - or substantially less - than joyous\n\n           sex, it is really just a drug-like inoculation against\n\n           reality. But the feeling quickly fades. All that\n\n           remains, as with most chance encounters, is regret.\n\n           And there is shame, too. This is put on display as Anna\n\n           turns away from Solomon. As quickly as it began, it is\n\n           as though the act had not happened at all.\n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n                         122 122\n\n\n\n                          OMIT\n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n          123 EXT.

They are engraved onto \n\n           the violin, in the hidden area where Solomon would rest \n\n           his chin. \n\n           Solomon looks at it for a moment, moving his fingertips \n\n           across the engraving.

Solomon,\n\n           aged significantly since then, stands nervously,\n\n           swallowing, and adjusting his attire. He breaths in and\n\n           holds his breath. He blows out and closes his eyes. A\n\n           tear falls from his cheek, but this is not the way he\n\n           wants his family to see him. He gathers himself, and\n\n           looks to his right. There stands Mr. Parker. He places\n\n           his hand on Solomon's shoulder. He says gently-\n\n\n\n                          PARKER\n\n           Are you ready?\n\n           Solomon swallows and nods.\n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n                         169 169\n\n\n\n           INT.

All around, the\n\n           body language of the family is stiff and awkward.
