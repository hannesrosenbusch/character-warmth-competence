He has flowers in his hair and\nsurrounding his shrouded body, his hands folded on his chest.\n\nA MEAGRE CROWD stands in front of this PYRE. To the fore are\nMACBETH and LADY MACBETH. Their faces ashen with grief.\nBehind them we see BANQUO and his son FLEANCE.\n\nLady Macbeth walks forward with a sprig of RED BERRIES.\nPlaces them reverently on her young son’s dead chest,\nfighting back tears.\n\nAfter her, Macbeth carefully lays oyster shells over the\nboy’s eyes. Then he scoops up a handful of black Scottish\nsoil and pours it over his son’s chest. Over his folded\nhands. Sending him to rest.\n\nEXT. FIELD NEAR INVERNESS - LATER\n\nThe platform is ablaze, the smoke disappearing into the vast\nlandscape. Macbeth’s arm is around Lady Macbeth. Their faces\nstricken.

BATTLEFIELD - DAY\n\nThat same MIST floats across a plain embedded in the Scottish\nmountains. Dark clouds are gathering in the sky above.\n\nOut of the mist walks Macbeth. He looks years older now, his\nface roughly bearded. A leader, a powerful and ferocious\nwarrior, his lean body cased in battered threadbare armour.\n\nBehind him emerges his ROUGH ARMY.\n\nThey are soldiers hardened against nature by years of\nfighting. Their WEAPONS hang heavily in their hands, their\nscarce armour soaked in the showering rain. We recognise some\nfrom the funeral, although time has clearly passed.\n\nFirst among their ranks is Banquo, Macbeth’s sturdy second in\nthis war. His eyes, like the eyes of all of the men, are\nfixed on something straight ahead across the plain.\nApprehensive.\n\nA group of about THIRTY REINFORCEMENTS. They are little more\nthan boys, 14-16 years old. Virgins to war, they’re terrified\n-- but also excited.\n\nMacbeth and Banquo look at each other with concern: these\nrecruits are not what they were expecting. The difference\nbetween the men and the boys is startling.\n\fEXT.

His hands are shaking too hard to grip his own\nsword and he drops it again and again, hopeless, as thick\ntears stream down his face.\n\nNearby, like his men, Macbeth is readying himself.\nRitualistically his hands run over his weapons, preparing\neach for its quickest draw:\n\nA LONG-SWORD edged with dents; a BASELARD on his back; a\nKNIFE coarsened with use; TWO DAGGERS sheathed on either side\nof his waist. His body a machine of war.\n\nHe is wearing a tabard that marks him out as the leader of\nthis force. Sewn into it is the Scottish symbol of the\nRampant Lion and, smaller, the crest of his house, Glamis.\nTied onto the tabard are DOG TAGS from soldiers who have\nfallen in past battles.\n\nHe looks down the line of his men, inspecting them. Their\nfear palpably assuages at his presence: they owe him their\nlives. Loyal.\n\nThen, Macbeth notices the shaking Young Boy Soldier. He\nstarts down the line towards him. Each Soldier bows their\nhead as he passes out of respect. All the Soldiers and young\nboys are wearing DOG TAGS marked with the same insignia.\n\nHe comes to a halt in front of the Young Boy Soldier and\ntakes him in. The boy stares up in awe, his tears stopped.\n\nCalmly Macbeth rips a piece of fabric from his uniform and\npicks up the fallen sword. Carefully he binds it to the Young\nBoy Soldier’s hand, fast. Their eyes meet: it’s time.\n\nAt this, a dim noise becomes noticeable on the edge of\nhearing. A RUMBLE. It is getting LOUDER.\n\nOne of the Young Soldiers tries to control his breaths, each\none catching in his throat.\n\fANOTHER of his young comrades vomits in fear.\nANOTHER chews his lip ferociously until it bleeds.",

Banquo nods to him.\nReady.\n\nAnd, finally, Macbeth turns with the men to face:\n\nA THICK, VAST BANK OF WHITE MIST\n\nAcross the plain.

He hauls the Young\nBoy Soldier to his feet and turns away.\n\nAs he does so, however, he catches a glimpse of something\nacross the field -- and STOPS DEAD.\n\nFOUR FORMS are watching from the edges of the battle. Utterly\nmotionless. As if watching him and him alone.\n\fThe chaos around Macbeth seems to SLOW, stilling for a\nmoment. Macbeth stands entranced, something about these\nWITCHES hypnotising him.

Intractably drawn,\nsearching, he calls out to the mist:\n\nMACBETH\nI conjure you, by that which you profess,\nHowe’er you come to know it, answer me!\n\nThere is no response.

He turns, the sound drawing him on towards it.\n\nFrom within the fog the forms of the WITCHES take shape,\nstanding over the red glow of a fire. An infant is CRYING.\n\nMacbeth walks toward them. The crying becomes CLEARER and\nLOUDER. And the mist clears, to reveal they are preparing\nsome kind of mixture over a flame.\n\nThe Older Witch is cradling an INFANT in her arms.
