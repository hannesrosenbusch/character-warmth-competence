Screaming, yelling. Black \n               figures flash across the foreground, with the flames still \n               burning behind. There follows a confusion of burning, raping, \n               killing and looting -- we don't clearly see what's going on.\n\n               Suddenly we cut to the interior of a hut. The door is in the \n               process of being broken down. The camera pans onto the close-\n               up face of an attractive girl who is staring in horrified \n               fascination at the door. Her arms are white with fresh dough \n               and flour.\n\n               Suddenly the door bursts open and a wild-looking Viking leaps \n               into the hut. He holds a sword. He looks around wildly and \n               then his eyes come to rest on the girl.\n\n               This Viking, I'm afraid, is Erik. We are about to see him in \n               the worst possible light so be prepared. The girl, whose \n               name is Helga, cowers, and looks terrified but resolute.\n\n               Erik glances round.\n\n               Then slowly he advances on the girl, forcing her back onto a \n               chest. Erik holds his sword to Helga's throat with his right \n               hand, while his left hand searches to find the thongs holding \n               up his trousers.\n\n               He is clearly having difficulties trying to hold his heavy \n               sword to Helga's throat at he same time as undoing his \n               trousers. He fumbles and lowers his sword for a moment.\n\n                                     HELGA\n                         Have you done this sort of thing \n                         before?\n\n                                     ERIK\n                         Me?

This Viking's name is \n               Thorfinn Skull-Splitter.\n\n               The axe thuds into the wall a few inches away from the face \n               of a frightened girl, Unn, who is pinned to the wall with \n               her braids spread out. The Vikings are hurling axes at her a \n               la Kirk Douglas in \"The Vikings\".\n\n               Several Vikings sitting at ale-bench, laugh in a rather \n               unpleasant way. Erik, however, frowns. He is sitting at a \n               table on a dais, next to his grandfather, the chief of the \n               village. His grandfather almost chokes with merriment. Erik's \n               mother glances at him with some hostility. Meanwhile the \n               drunken Thorfinn has just lifted the totally legless Ivar \n               the Boneless up off the floor and presses an axe into his \n               hand. A tremor of nervousness ripples round the females in \n               the Mead Hall. Ivar is clearly in no condition to throw \n               anything, except, perhaps, the contents of his stomach. Unn \n               winces.\n\n               Finally, amidst much giggling, Ivar throws wildly, and the \n               axe smashes into a jug being carried by one of the serving \n               girls. The menfolk erupt into drunken hysterics at this. The \n               women clearly feel that the occasion is getting out of hand. \n               But before any of them can work up enough courage to \n               intervene, Thorfinn Skull-Splitter has thrust an axe into \n               the hands of the even more plastered Sven the Berserk. Now \n               Sven is not the Viking to let a little matter like not being \n               able to see straight stop him heaving the axe at a young \n               maiden. He takes the axe and whirls it wildly over his head. \n               Even the other drunken Vikings realize this could be \n               dangerous, and they cower behind the table. Sven lets go of \n               the axe. Unn shuts her eyes prepared for the worst. There is \n               a dull thud and a grunt and then a whoop of mirth.",

On the opposite side sits Harald \n               Missionary, a rather seedy cleric who has long since given \n               up trying to convert the pagans and found solace in their \n               mead.

As the volume \n               increases the Golden Dragon itself begins to reverberate \n               with the sound. Rings of ripples begin to radiate out from \n               the boat across the calm water. The note grows louder and \n               louder, and the Vikings, who at first were laughing and \n               cheering at Aud's success, begin to get rather alarmed. Louder \n               and louder gets the note and the Horn shakes and the boat \n               vibrates. Things start to be shaken loose, and fall onto the \n               deck. Ropes uncoil and run loose. A heavy block suddenly \n               crashes down to the deck, crowning Harald and laying him out \n               flat. Louder and louder grows the note, and the Vikings have \n               to stop their ears for the pain. The water around the ship \n               becomes more and more agitated. And then another sound is \n               heard. It is the thunder of water in the distance like a \n               million distant waterfalls. And suddenly they notice the sea \n               is running like a river -- all in one direction... sweeping \n               the ship forward with incredible momentum. In no time they \n               are engulfed in a mist, still traveling at a rate of knots.\n\n               Almost at once an appointed rock looms out of the mist ahead \n               of them. Erik flings himself at the steering oar, and everyone \n               is thrown about as the ship veers wildly and just misses the \n               rock, only to see another looming up ahead of them.",

The noise is deafening. It would be \n               almost impossible to hear any voice above it.\n\n               The faces of the Vikings betray their fear as they find \n               themselves emerging from out of the mist at the Edge of the \n               World. They gape as they find themselves confronted by a \n               Waterfall of Seas -- stretching on either side of them -- as \n               far as the eye can see -- water falling and plunging over \n               the lip of the world. And in front of them -- the blue sky \n               continues on down and down until it shades into blackness \n               strewn with stars beneath their feet...\n\n               Sven, Sven's dad and Keitel edge to the prow and gasp.\n\n                                     AUD\n                         No!

Sven, his dad and Keitel peer over the side, \n               and stare down into the abyss. They gasp. From above we see \n               the prow of Golden Dragon and the backs of the Vikings' heads \n               in plain view against a backdrop of stars below them.\n\n                                     ERIK\n                         Let me see!\n\n               Aud holds him back.\n\n                                     AUD\n                         No. Don't look...

The scene that greets their eyes is \n               not at all what they had been prepared for.\n\n               Valhalla is not full of the warriors slain in battle, quaffing \n               mead on the ale-bench and reliving old battles -- it is, \n               instead full of children romping, laughing, shouting, \n               quarreling and playing games... chess, fencing... dice... \n               tag, etc., around a wide hearth fire. Women are cooking and \n               doing other housewifely things... weaving, making bread, \n               etc. It is a thoroughly domestic scene.

They have a few sackfuls of booty with them. They herd \n               the women, children and old men into a pathetic huddle in \n               the middle of the village.
