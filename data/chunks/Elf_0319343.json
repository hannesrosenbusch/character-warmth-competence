Elves love to tell stories, you probably didn't know that, did you?  Well, there's a lot of things about us that people don't know.  For instance, we can't tell a lie.  It's physiologically impossible.  Here's another interesting Elf-ism: There are three jobs available to an Elf.  You can make shoes at night while an old cobbler sleeps...but it's not exactly the most rewarding work.\n\nQUICK CUT AWAY TO\n\nTwo ELVES hammering away at a pile of shoes as a fat shoemaker sleeps with a copy of \"Hot Cobbler\" magazine on his chest, a busty cobbler lady on the cover.\n\nDISGRUNTLED COBBLER ELF\n\nLazy bastard couldn't even make a flip-flop...\n\nEXT.

We need to get these cameras back on!\n\nJovie looks around.  Trying to think of a plan.  Inspired, she climbs atop a horse's carriage and looks out over the crowd.  She's intimidated.\n\nJOVIE\n\n(to herself)\n\nThe best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear...\n\nEXT. CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS\n\nWalter, standing watch, sees the MOUNTED POLICE CHARGING.\n\nWALTER\n\nGet out of here!  They're coming!  There's enough Christmas spirit to start moving!\n\nBuddy jumps in.  The sleigh slowly hovers forward a foot off the ground, in a herky-jerky way.  The MOUNTED RIDERS come at Walter who wears Santa's hat and coat.  He attempts to be a decoy.\n\nWALTER\n\nHey!  I'm right here!  Ho ho ho!  You got me!  I surrender!\n\nThey ride right past him and after the sleigh.\n\nEXT. CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS\n\nBuddy and Santa swerve past trees, scraping bark and smashing branches.
