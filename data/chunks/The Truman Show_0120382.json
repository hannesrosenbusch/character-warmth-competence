After a\nlong moment, a hand wipes the condensation from the glass to\nreveal the face of TRUMAN BURBANK. He wears a sleeveless\nHanes undershirt and blue-stripe pajama bottoms, behind him a\nwhite glazed tiled bathroom wall. It is immediately apparent\nthat we are viewing him through a two-way mirror.\n\nTruman, expressionless, studies his reflection in the mirror.\nFora long moment, he does nothing. He continues to look\nimpassively into the mirror for what becomes an uncomfortably\nlong time. Still nothing. Finally he speaks, talking to\nhimself in the mirror as if participating in a TV interview.\n\nTRUMAN\n\n+-+-personally I think the unconquered\nsouth face is the only one worth\nscaling...of course it’s a 20,000 foot\nsheer wall of ice but then when did that\never stop me before?...Naturally, I\nintend to make the ascent without the\nbenefit of oxygen but also without\ncrampons or even an ice pick...risks?...\n\n(smug, TV smile)\n+.-Sure I’m aware of the risks--why else\ndo you think I would spend seven years as\nan adjuster in a life insurance\ncompany. ..?\n\nMERYL (0.S.)\nTruman, you're gonna be late!\n\nTruman resignedly opens the door of the cabinet and replaces\nhis shaving tackle.
