An understanding of what this\nwas: Letting their sons see their dad as a “hero for a\nmoment,” instead of “the coward they had witnessed.” Peter\nseems grateful. Then,...\n\nBILLIE (CONT'D)\n(very casual)\nI should get my skis.\n\nWith that, she just walks back up. But, not before...\n\nBILLIE (CONT'D)\n(whispering to Pete)\n\nBy the way, knee deep powder.

The Twins chase one another out.\n\nPETE\nHold up. You guys are more than\ncapable of taking your own bags.\n\nThe Twins return, grabbing their suitcases and head back out.\n\nAs Billie passes by Pete in the doorway, he stops her.\n\nPETE (CONT'D)\nI'll give you more reasons not go\nto Switzerland.\n\nA promise to be there.
