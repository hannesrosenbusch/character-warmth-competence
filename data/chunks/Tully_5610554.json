He is shirtless but wears pajama pants.\n\nThe song “Space Oddity,” as performed by a children’s choir\nplays on Jonah’s little CD player.\n\nMarlo holds a strange little PLASTIC BRUSH with nylon\nbristles. It’s not for Jonah’s hair. Instead, she runs the\nbrush in long, smooth strokes down her son’s bare arm.\n\nMARLO\nHold still, Jonah.\n\nShe moves to the other side, running the brush down the other\narm, gently pressing the soft bristles into his skin.\n\nMARLO (CONT’D)\nThere we go. Let’s do feet now. Sit\ndown.\n\nJonah sits down. He casually grabs his crotch and holds on.\n\nMARLO (CONT’D)\nDo you need to go to the bathroom?\n\nJonah continues holding himself.\n\nJONAH\nNo.\n\nMARLO\nJust being your own best friend,\nhuh?\n\nJonah nods blithely.\n\nMARLO (CONT'D)\nOkay.\n\nShe resumes brushing, gently running the bristles over the\nsoles of Jonah’s BARE FEET.\n\nINT.
