HIS\nPOV: a dark void, flashbulbs, shadows, a crowd of unseen\nfans. He starts to play again but stops - for the first time\nin thirty years not knowing what to say. We see the moment\nfrom multiple angles and angels. From high up, Miles looks\nsmall.\n\nMiles looks to the wings, searching... for someone among\nthose standing around, and beyond... a face he cannot find...\n\nREVERSE ANGLE - POV of Miles from an empty void in the wings,\nCAMERA moves a little.

Perfect.\n\nOn TV, Miles mashes out an atonal chord with his right hand\nand cranks the volume louder and louder, silencing the band.\nAs the din of the chord reverberates, recedes, he\ncontemplates the trumpet’s bell, etched with a curvaceous\nscroll, his name in bold, flickering blue in the stage light.\n\nDAVE (0.S.)
