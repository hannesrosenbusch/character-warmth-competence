Bud picks up the blotter pad with his\n\nstuff on it, and as he moves past Moffett's desk, Moffett\n\ntakes out a dollar bill, drops it grudgingly on the loaded\n\npad. Bud flashes him a little grin, continues between the\n\ndesks toward the row of glass-enclosed offices housing the\n\nsupervisory personnel.\n\n\n\nHe comes up to an unoccupied cubicle. A sign painter is\n\nbrushing in some new lettering on the glass door -- it reads\n\nC. C. BAXTER, Second Administrative Assistant.

From a distance, she is studying Bud\n\nwith interest. On the bar in front of her is a container of\n\nstraws in paper wrappers. She takes one of them out, tears\n\noff the end of the paper, blows through the straw -- sending\n\nthe wrapper floating toward Bud. The paper wrapper passes\n\nright in front of Bud's nose. He doesn't notice it.\n\n\n\nMargie, undaunted, lets go with another missile.\n\n\n\nThis time the wrapper lands on the brim of Bud's bowler. No\n\nreaction. Another wrapper comes floating in, hits Bud's\n\ncheek. He never takes his eye off his martini.\n\n\n\nMargie leaves her place, and carrying her handbag and her\n\nempty glass, comes up alongside Bud.

THE APARTMENT - EVENING\n\n\n\nBuddy-boy is bending over a hot stove, preparing an Italian\n\ndinner. He takes a saucepan of spaghetti off the fire, and\n\npicking up the tennis racquet with the other hand, pours the\n\nspaghetti on top of the racquet strings. Then he turns on\n\nthe faucet, runs water over the spaghetti. With the combined\n\ntechnique of Brillat-Savarin and Pancho Gonzales, he gently\n\nagitates the racquet, letting the water drain off the\n\nspaghetti. As he works, he hums a theme from Tschaikowsky's\n\nCapriccio Italien.\n\n\n\nFran walks in, still in her robe.\n\n\n\n                         FRAN\n\n            Are we dressing for dinner?\n\n\n\n                         BUD\n\n            No -- just come as you are.\n\n\n\n                         FRAN\n\n                   (watching him)\n\n            Say, you're pretty good with that\n\n            racquet.\n\n\n\n                         BUD\n\n            You ought to see my backhand.\n\n                   (dumping spaghetti\n\n                   into platter)\n\n            And wait till I serve the meatballs.\n\n                   (demonstrates)\n\n\n\n\n\n                         FRAN\n\n            Shall I light the candles?\n\n\n\n                         BUD\n\n            It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.\n\n\n\nAs Fran starts into the living room, Bud begins to ladle\n\nmeat sauce onto the spaghetti, humming operatically.\n\n\n\nIn the living room, the small table has been set for two,\n\nand prominent on it is the champagne bottle that Mr. Kirkeby\n\nleft behind, still in its cardboard bucket, but freshly iced.\n\nAs Fran lights the candles, she notices the napkins on the\n\ntable, peels a price-tag off the corner of one of them.",

FRAN\n\n            I'm going to send him a fruit cake\n\n            every Christmas. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\nBud sinks down happily on the couch, and Fran holds out the\n\ndeck to him.\n\n\n\n                         FRAN\n\n            Cut.\n\n\n\nBud cuts a card, but doesn't look at it.\n\n\n\n                         BUD\n\n            I love you, Miss Kubelik.\n\n\n\n                         FRAN\n\n                   (cutting a card)\n\n            Seven --\n\n                   (looking at Bud's card)\n\n            -- queen.\n\n\n\nShe hands the deck to Bud.\n\n\n\n                         BUD\n\n            Did you hear what I said, Miss\n\n            Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.\n\n\n\n                         FRAN\n\n                   (smiling)\n\n            Shut up and deal!\n\n\n\nBud begins to deal, never taking his eyes off her. Fran\n\nremoves her coat, starts picking up her cards and arranging\n\nthem. Bud, a look of pure joy on his face, deals -- and\n\ndeals -- and keeps dealing.\n\n\n\nAnd that's about it. Story-wise.\n\n\n\n                                            FADE OUT.\n\n\n\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              THE END\n\n\n"
