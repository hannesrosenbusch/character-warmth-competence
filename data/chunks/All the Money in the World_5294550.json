And now, from out of the\ncrowd, something even stranger emerges:\n\nA BOY\n\nin his mid-teens, at once streetwise and innocent. A skinny\nkid in worn jeans with iron-on patches on the knees. The\nstreetwalkers in their platform shoes call out to him:\n\nPROSTITUTES\nCiao, Paolo!\n\nThe kid smiles bashfully as they fall in around him.\n\nPROSTITUTES (CONT'D)\nChe magro, che vergogna!

A moment -- and then he runs.\n\nIn an instant, they are upon him. The boy flails, kicking\nand writhing to buck them off.
