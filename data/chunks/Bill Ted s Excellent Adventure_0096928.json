DESERT - LONG SHOT - DAY\nA brilliant yellow sun beats down on a vast orangeish\nwasteland. As we begin a long, slow PAN of the desert, the\nfollowing is SUPERED onto the screen:\n\n\"SAN DIMAS, CALIFORNIA\"\nTITLE FADES, and is replaced by:\n\n“2687 A.D.\"\n\nThen that TITLE also FADES. Continue PANNING, and finally\nFINISH PAN ON:\n\n_A CLUSTER OF FUTURISTIC DOMES\n\nwhich shimmer in the distance.\n\nSoon a distant SOLITARY FIGURE, dressed all in black,\nsilently strides INTO FRAME, dust kicking up behind ‘hin.\n\nAs the Figure approaches the largest of the domes, we begin\nto MOVE IN, and we:\n\ncuT To:\nINT. DOME\nA magnificent, crystalline structure -- like a vast,\nfuturistic cathedral. Everything about this place implies\ngrandeur, solemnity and importance.\nDeep, metallic MUSIC echoes through the dome as --\nTWO HUGE DOORS\nopen, and the Figure enters. This is:\nRUFUS\nAnd he is the personification of everything that'is, has\nbeen, or will be rock and roll. Cool, cavalier, and cocky,\nhe’ is dressed very stylishly and wears ultra-hip\nsunglasses.\nHe steps inside the hall, the two huge doors shutting\n\nsolidly behind him. He begins walking, his footsteps\nechoing loudly.\n\f \n\nO\n\nHe stops in the middle of the room and nods respectfully\ntoward:\n\nTHE OTHER END OF THE ROOM\n\nwhere, for the first time, we SEE three FIGURES, seated in\nmid-air, as if suspended invisibly. All have long hair and\nbeards (sort of like the members of ZZ Top), wear white,\nsport dark sunglasses, and slowly tap their feet in rhythm\nto the echoing, metallic music.\n\nThese are the three most important people in the world.",

The Leader motions toward:\n\nTHE CENTER OF THE ROOM : .\nwhere the ceiling begins to iris open, BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT\n\n. pouring through the widening chasm. Soon the light is\n\npierced by:\nA LARGE, BLACK OBELISK\n\nwhich, barely visible through the brightness, begins to\ndescend toward the floor.\n\nThis spectacular explosion of LIGHT and MUSIC reaches a\ntumultuous crescendo, then suddenly stops. The ceiling\nirises closed.\n\nTHE LEADER\n\nlooks at the obelisk, then gestures with his hand and:\nTHE OBELISK\n\nbegins a rapid and magical transformation.\n\nWhen complete, the obelisk has taken the form of a 1987\nPHONE BOOTH. Glass doors, a telephone, the works.\n\f \n\n© RUFUS AND THE FIGURES\n\nstare reverently at the booth. After a moment, Rufus flips\ndown his shades and turns to the Figures.\n\nRUFUS\nGentlemen. Be excellent to\neach other.\nThe Figures nod gravely back at Rufus.\n\nFIGURES\nParty on, dude.\n\nRufus neds and enters --\nTHE PHONE BOOTH\n\nwhere he flips through the attached PHONE BOOK and locates\na number.\n\nAs Rufus lifts the receiver, we SEE a small, two-pronged\nANTENNA rise out of the booth and begin to GLOW with a\nbluish light.\n\nThen, with each number Rufus dials, we SEE the BLUE LIGHT\nfrom the antenna move down the side of the booth,\naccompanied by a corresponding CHORD OF HEAVY METAL MUSIC.\n\n \n\nFinally, we HEAR a DRUM BEAT, and as --\nTHE BLUE LIGHT\nconnects with the ground, the floor beneath the booth\nsuddenly opens up with a WHOOSH and, in a brilliant FLASH\nof BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT and RAUCOUS ROCK AND ROLL ...\nINT.

SCHOOL BUS STOP - DAY\n\nBILL and TED jump INTO FRAME, land on the bus stop bench,\nand do a series of spasmodic AIR GUITAR riffs. Then, as\nthey leap off the bench TOWARD CAMERA, we begin:\n\nA QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS\n\nIn which Bill and Ted do a brief, MTV-type AIR GUITAR mini-\nconcert:\n\nThey spin around on their backs; play their air-guitars\nwith their teeth, feet, and ears; trade “solos\"; and\noo finally, in a resounding conclusion, violently smash their\nCD air-instruments against the ground, garnering strange looks\nfrom the few people around them.\n\f \n\nThey guys look at each other, quite pleased, as the SCHOOL\nBUS pulls up in front of them.\n\nINT.
