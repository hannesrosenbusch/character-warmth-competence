MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT\n\nBlack screen.\n\nA rumbling sound. It intensifies.\n\nA woman's face appears suddenly in close up, shocked,\ndisoriented. It is AMELIA (late 30s.) She travels fast,\n\npinned back to what could be a car seat. It’s not clear.\n\nShe is suddenly lifted up and around, her face tumbling\nas if in a dryer, 360 degrees.\n\nThe image slows down as she shuts her eyes. Bits of dirt\nand debris fly past her face. There’s no sound. The\neffect is strangely beautiful.\n\nBOY'S VOICE (0.S.)\n(Nearly inaudible.) Mummy....\n\nAmelia tries to open her eyes, she continues to spin.\nHer face stops tumbling and comes to an upright position.\nA skidding sound builds in intensity. Her hand reaches\nabove to brace herself for the impact. She turns to look\n\nbeside her. Time is stretched.\n\nShe sees a man staring ahead. He looks terrified. A light\ngrows brighter. The skidding sound is almost deafening.\n\nAmelia instinctively looks away from him, closing her\neyes. The terrible sound peaks, then slowly recedes.\n\nBOY'S VOICE (0.S.)\n(CONT'D)\n(Louder still) MUM.\n\nAmelia hears the boy’s voice for the first time. She\nopens her eyes as she ‘falls’ slowly back into space.\n\nFinally, she ‘lands’. There is complete silence.\n\nAmelia is lying on a pillow. She looks at the ceiling,\ndazed. Her breathing is erratic.\n\nBOY'S VOICE (CONT'D)\n(Very loud) MUMMY!\n\nShe sees her six year old son, SAMUEL, bedside. He's\nsmall for his age, intense.",

Her fluffy\nMaltese terrier, BUGSY, jumps off the bed with her. She\nscrambles to her feet, stumbling on the way to her son.\nINT. SAMUEL'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nPOV under the bed. The doona is lifted. Amelia and Samuel\npeer underneath. The doona is dropped back into place.\n\nBlack. Closet doors open, Amelia takes a quick look\ninside, Samuel checks everywhere. Amelia closes it.\n\nAmelia is dark haired and wiry. Pretty, but nervous\nlooking. Samuel's little face is white with anxiety. He\nmoves back and forth from one foot to the other.\n\nSAMUEL\nCan we check under the bed?\n\nAMELIA\n(Patient) What did it look like?\n\nSamuel shrugs his shoulders. He can’t remember.\nAMELIA (CONT'D)\nRemember what we said? If you can’t see\nit, then it mustn’t be real.\n\nSAMUEL\nIt said it’s coming to kill us both.\n\nHis comment unnerves Amelia. She recovers quickly.\nAMELIA\n(Very gentle) It’s just a silly dream.\nINT. SAMUEL'S ROOM - NIGHT\nAmelia searches through the bookshelf. Samuel clings to\nher waist, not letting go. Bugsy follows them.\nINT. AMELIA’S BEDROOM - A SHORT WHILE LATER\nAmelia sits up in bed, Samuel in her lap, the doona\n\nsurrounds them like a giant caterpillar. Amelia gives the\nbook everything she’s got, fighting her tiredness.\n\fAMELIA\n(In the voice of the wolf) ‘Well I'll\nclimb down your chimney you fat little\npigs!’ And he climbed down that chimney,\nstraight into the huge black pot .

AMELIA’S BEDROOM - A SHORT WHILE LATER\n\nLittle legs wrapped tightly around Amelia’s waist.\n\nSamuel’s face tucked in behind his mother’s. He’s fast\nasleep, she’s wide awake.\n\nHis mouth, chewing at nothing, grinding away. The sound\ngoes right through Amelia. His breath irritates her neck.\n\nHis hand plays with her ear in his sleep. She peels it\naway, puts it by his side.\n\fShe unwraps his legs, making sure she doesn’t wake him.\n\nAmelia inches silently away from her son, her back to\nhim. Samuel doesn’t wake up. The gap between them widens.\n\nAmelia curls up on the other side of the bed, her knees\nto her chest, alone.\n\nTITLE - THE BABADOOK\n\nINT. AMELIA’S BEDROOM/BASEMENT/LOUNGE/KITCHEN - MORNING\n\n- Bedroom. A blaring alarm sounds. A lifeless arm pokes\nout from under the doona, hanging over the bed. It’s hard\nto believe someone could sleep through this noise.\n\n- Basement. Child’s hands grip a large hammer. The hammer\nis raised and comes down hard on a rusty nail.\n\nLittle hands pushing down on a join in two pieces of\nwood, testing it for strength.\n\n- Bedroom. The alarm keeps going. The arm has not moved.\n\n- Basement.

LOUNGE ROOM - MORNING\nAmelia reaches the bottom stairs.\n\nSam's catapult covers his body, comes up over his head.\nAt the top sits a plastic cup with a cricket ball in it.\n\nThe lounge room is a mess, swords, toy soldiers and other\n‘boy war paraphernalia’ everywhere. The big old tube TV\nhas been knocked off its stand and lies on its side.\nBugsy is in the midst of it, barking, wagging his tail.\nAmelia struggles with all her might to hold her temper.\n\nSAMUEL\nIt’s not broken!
