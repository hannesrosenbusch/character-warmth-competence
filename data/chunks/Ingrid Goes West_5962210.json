MUSIC blasts as Ingrid enters\nwearing a sheet with eye holes, weaving through the crowd. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\nShe finds an outdoor outlet and plugs in her phone, noticing\na platter of tiny sandwiches on the table next to her. She\ngrabs one and lifts her sheet, devouring it quickly.\n\nIngrid stuffs a few more into her pocket and is about to head\nfor the bar when she hears a familiar voice. She turns.\n\nHER POV - Taylor is standing nearby, dressed as Cher from\nClueless and talking to Harley who is dressed as Dionne.\n\nIngrid tries to quickly walk past them when someone steps on\nher sheet, pulling it off her in one fell swoop. She\nscrambles to cover herself when Taylor looks over, confused.\n\nTAYLOR\nIngrid...?\n\nIngrid covers herself with the sheet, pretending not to hear.\n\nTAYLOR (CONT’D)\nIngrid, I can see you. We all can.\n\nEveryone turns, staring at Ingrid. Ingrid slowly removes the\nsheet, trying to play it cool.\n\f114.\n\nINGRID\nHey, Taylor. Happy Halloween.\n\nTAYLOR\nWhat are you doing here? You\nweren’t invited.\n\nINGRID\nThe music was really loud, so... if\nyou wouldn't mind keeping it down,\nI have an important meeting\ntomorrow, SO...\n\nTAYLOR\nA meeting for what?\n\nINGRID\n(sadly)\nWhat the fuck do you care?\nA dude starts filming the confrontation with his phone.\n\nEzra appears from inside, sporting a new short haircut and\nmoustache and dressed as Bernie from Weekend at Bernie’s.\n\nEZRA\nYou want me to call the cops?\nTAYLOR\nIt’s fine.\nINGRID\n(re: Ezra)\n\nYou're still with this guy?\n\nTAYLOR\nNot that it’s any of your business,\nbut our marriage is fine. Unlike\nyou, we’re working through our\nissues.\n\nEZRA\nI’m ninety days sober.\n\nTAYLOR\n(proudly)\nEzra’s a concept designer for\nLevis.\n\nINGRID\nI know, I saw your Instagram.\nCongratulations.\n\f115.\n\nTAYLOR\nGo home, Ingrid.

You were just like me.\nEzra says nothing. Taylor looks at Ingrid with pity.\n\nTAYLOR\nI was never like you, Ingrid.\n\nA long, painful silence. Everyone stares down at their feet.\n\nCLOSE on Ingrid, fighting back tears. She nods, taking a\ndeep breath, steeling herself...\n\nINGRID\nIf you could keep the music down\nI'd really appreciate it.\nIngrid walks back towards her house. She pauses, turning\naround. Everyone watches as she walks across the entire\nparty and unplugs her phone.\n\nINGRID (CONT'D)\nForgot my phone.\n\nIngrid exits once again. A long beat, then --\n\nEveryone resumes dancing and partying as if nothing happened.\nWe TRACK with Ingrid as she walks across the desert, the\nparty continuing behind her, tears running down her cheeks...\nINT. 22 FLAMINGO LANE - NIGHT\n\nECU: A cheap tealight candle being lit with a match.\n\nIngrid is seated on the floor of her now-spotless living\nroom, surrounded by lit candles. She stares at her phone.\n\nPOV —- THROUGH AN IPHONE CAMERA\n\nWe are CLOSE on Ingrid’s face as she presses the red RECORD\nbutton on an Instagram video. She takes a deep breath.\n\f116.\n\nINGRID\nThey say that friends are the family\nyou choose, but... What if the\npeople you choose don’t choose you?\n(pause)\n\nI thought moving to L.A. would be\nmy chance to start over. A chance\nto live the life I always wanted --\n\nThe video STOPS at the 15-second limit. Ingrid sighs. She\npresses ‘Share’ and hits the record button again.\n\nINGRID (CONT'D)\nI thought if I made my life seem\nperfect and happy, maybe someone\nwould choose me, but... it didn’t\nmatter. I guess the problem is me.\nThe only person who ever chose me\nis gone now, so... why even bother?\n\n(pause)\n\nI’m so tired --\n\nThe video STOPS recording.\n\nINGRID (CONT'D)\nshit!\n\nIngrid presses ‘Share’ and hits the record button again.\n\nINGRID (CONT'D)\nI'm tired of having to pretend to\nbe something I’m not.",

So...\n\n(shrugs )\n\nHere I am.\n\nSilence. Ingrid picks up a bottle of prescription pills and\ndumps it into her mouth, washing it down with a Corona and\nwincing. She hits the ‘Share’ button and sets down her phone.\n\nIngrid lies back onto the floor, surrounded by candles, and\npresses play on her laptop. Seal’s “KISS FROM A ROSE” plays.\n\nShe sets up the framed Instagram photo of her and Taylor and\nsmiles at it one last time.
