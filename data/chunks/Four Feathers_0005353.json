Mason\n\n\n\nEXT. TRAINING GROUND/ WESTMINSTER barracks/ LONDON - Day.\n\nThrough a veil of dust we see two lines of uniformed cavalry, stretched out across the parade ground. There's a tense silence except for the occasional flourish of hooves. A horseman steps out of each line. \n\nLIEUTENANTS HARRY FEVERSHAM and JOHN DURRANCE face each other across the wide expanse. Already we feel the keen sense of competition between them. DURRANCE raises his sabre first. His horse sets off at a slow trot. His troops follow in perfect time. HARRY waits a moment, then raises his own sword. A sea of sabres rises up in response. \n\nThe two lines approach each other at a steady canter. A smile of anticipation lights up DURRANCE's face. He's a born soldier, enjoying himself. HARRY looks more nervous. He's not as easy as Durrance in the saddle. It's a skill he's acquired over the years rather than been born to.\n\nDURRANCE seems to sense Harry's doubt. With a loud whoop he kicks his horse into a gallop and points his sabre forwards. His troops echo his war cry and descend on the opposing line at speed. HARRY checks his troops and responds. The two lines bear down on each other, hooves thundering, sabres pointed. \n\nDURRANCE charges recklessly. His eyes are fixed on Harry all the time. HARRY holds his gaze, but doesn't look as sure of himself. He's thinking too much, trying too hard. His horse senses it and slows a fraction. The troops behind him lose their cohesion as they draw level. \n\nDURRANCE sees the momentary lapse and waves his men on at full tilt. They pass through HARRY's troops in a perfect line, panicking their mounts, cheering triumphantly. HARRY's formation loses its shape. There's no doubt who's won the drill.",

Changing room/ WESTMINSTER BARRACKS - day.\n\nMoving through clouds of steam we see the CAVALRY OFFICERS washing themselves in wooden bathtubs. There's a din of voices, soldiers re-living the day's drill, those on Durrance's side still crowing over their victory.\n\nDURRANCE walks with his arm around HARRY. With them is another friend, LIEUTENANT TRENCH, a squat bull of a man.\n\nDURRANCE\n\n...How many does that make it Harry?\n\nharry\n\nIt's not something I count.\n\nDURRANCE\n\nHow many Trench?\n\nharry\n\nTrench can't count.\n\nTRENCH grabs HARRY in a neck hold. He lets go as he spots another friend of theirs, LIEUTENANT CASTELTON, sitting in a bathtub, staring out. TRENCH sneaks up on CASTELTON, and ducks his head under the water. CASTELTON comes up, spluttering. He reaches for a bar of soap and hurls it after TRENCH.\n\nCASTELTON\n\n...Idiot.\n\nINT. WILLOUGHBY's rooms/ barracks - day.\n\nA fifth friend, LIEUTENANT WILLOUGHBY, stares at himself in the mirror. His hair like his uniform is perfect. There's a loud knocking on his door.\n\ntrench o/s\n\n...Miss Willoughby, Miss Willoughby we're waiting.\n\nWILLOUGHBY finally stops preening himself as he hears his friends picking the lock. He gets up reluctantly, taking one last look at his reflection in the mirror.\n\nEXT. BARRACK GATES/ LONDON STREET - DAY.                                                 \n\nThe OFFICERS pour out of the barrack gates in full regimental unifom, a sea of gleaming red. We pick out HARRY, DURRANCE, TRENCH, WILLOUGHBY, and CASTELTON, laughing amongst themselves, taking turns to tease each other, inseperable. \n\nINT. carriage/ HAnsom cab/ london streets - day.\n\nThe friends share a flask of whisky as they sit in the back of the carriage.

PARTY/ india office building/ london - night.\n\nCARRIAGES line the entrance to the India Office. INDIAN VALETS in turbans and robes escort the GUESTS to the entrance, holding umbrellas over them. \n\nThe five friends crowd under a single umbrella. WILLOUGHBY makes sure he's in the middle, he doesn't want to get his uniform wet. TRENCH nudges him into the rain.\n\nINT. The Durbar court/ party/ INDIA office - night.\n\nPalm trees and fountains dominate the room. The ladies are dressed in ballgowns, the Officers in regimental colours. The full pomp and ceremony of Empire is on display. HARRY, DURRANCE, WILLOUGHBY, CASTELTON and TRENCH have  gathered by the bar, a little overawed by the occasion.\n\ntrench\n\n(Admiring the passing women)\n\nI'm going to ask someone to dance.\n\nwilloughby\n\n(Admiring the passing Generals)\n\nYou said that ten minutes ago.\n\ntrench\n\nI'm waiting for Castelton.\n\nCASTELTON stares at the ARISTOCRATIC WOMEN, paralysed with shyness.\n\ntrench \n\n(Pouring him another drink)\n\n...Just look dreamy.

We sense there's something on his mind, something he wants to tell Durrance. DURRANCE doesn't pick up on it. He finishes his whisky and looks back into the throng.\n\nWILLOUGHBY\n\nHarry, your father...\n\nHARRY looks away from DURRANCE. He sees his father, GENERAL FEVERSHAM, shaking hands with some COLLEAGUES across the room.\n\nINT. seating area/ durbar court/ india office - night.\n\nGENERAL FEVERSHAM is deep in conversation with his friend, COLONEL SUTCH, a fellow veteran of the Crimean war.

He lets father and son talk. \n\nGENERAL FEVERSHAM\n\nIs Ethne here?\n\nHARRY\n\nNot yet.\n\nThey both smile, as if they share a secret.

Her eyes stay on him a moment, but it's only to see if Harry's nearby. When she realises he isn't she looks away. Finally she sees him, standing with GENERAL FEVERSHAM and COLONEL SUTCH. She takes her father DERMOD's hand, and leads him in their direction.\n\nINT. bar area/ the durbar court/ india office - night.\n\nCASTELTON and TRENCH are back at the bar, arguing.\n\nCASTELTON\n\nYour sole purpose in life is to annoy me.\n\ntrench\n\nShe couldn't see me.\n\nCASTELTON\n\nI could see you.

HARRY and DURRANCE stand on wobbly stools, downing pints of beer. As soon as their glasses are empty they set off down the hall at a sprint. It's an obstacle course. The two friends duck under two long tables, and crawl on their bellies, towards two more glasses. \n\nTRENCH and CASTELTON are busy laying bets on who'll win.

Faces come at us out of the dark, screaming and cursing, shoving each other violently, raising their faces to the ceiling, gasping for air.\n\nAs our eyes adjust to the light, the vision of hell intensifies. The PRISONERS are manacled and herded into a space no more than thirty feet wide. They circle the room in a clockwise direction, pushed on by each other in perpetual motion, afraid that if they stop they'll be sucked under the maelstrom and trampled underfoot.\n\nThe most fortunate are those who've found a resting space in the corners of the room. They cling to the walls, fighting off anyone who tries to share their sanctuary. From somewhere amongst them we hear a familiar voice:\n\ntrench\n\nGet away! This is Ibrahim's space!\n\nTRENCH protects his corner, lashing out at anyone who tries to breach the space. He bellows at the top of his voice:\n\ntrENCH \n\nIbrahim, where are you?!\n\nA voice answers from the heaving mass.
