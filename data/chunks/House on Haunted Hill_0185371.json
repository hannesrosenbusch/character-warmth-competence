Alone inside a small wood and glass cubicle, he\n     rips off yesterday's day-at-a-time calendar page, revealing\n     today's date: October 11, 1931.\n\n     Goes to the Victrola inside the cubicle. Cranks the turntable\n     up to speed. Puts the huge needle down on a spinning 78: we\n     hear the song crackling through the empty halls of the\n     hospital -- depression-era Muzak: Horace Heidt & His Musical\n     Knight's \"Keep Your Sunny Side Up\"\n\n     The Nurse sharpens the last of a half-dozen pencils to needle-\n     points, sits down at his desk, and begins the tedium of\n     jotting entries into a tall stack of Patient Records.\n\n     Beat. And then he hears a soft, almost paw-like tapping on\n     the glass. He looks up: a PATIENT with a heavily bandaged\n     head is standing there, his eyes as dull and lifeless as\n     marbles.\n\n     The Nurse waves the Patient away. Goes back to his work.\n     Beat. And then the tapping is heard again.",

Likewise bandaged, staring silent and dead-eyed at\n     him.\n\n     Unnerved, the Nurse's finger slowly stretches towards a\n     buzzer-button just below the desk-top. It never makes it.\n     Because --\n\n     A HAND - lashes into frame and grabs the Nurse's fingers. The\n     Nurse looks up.\n\n     In addition to the mass of Patients outside the cubicle,\n     there are now six of them inside it, surrounding him. The\n     Nurse's eyes shoot to the still-locked doors of the cubicle,\n     and he utters one confused word --\n\n                           MALE NURSE\n                 -- how -- ?\n\n      -- and then someone rams all six of his needle-sharp pencils\n     eraser-deep into his throat.\n\n     The Nurse gurgles and staggers -- falls back against the\n     Victrola, hitting the turntable crank as he goes down,\n     causing it to start spinning like a pinwheel.\n\n     \"Keep Your Sunny Side Up\" now blares through the halls triple-\n     time, sounding like a thousand manic chipmunks.
