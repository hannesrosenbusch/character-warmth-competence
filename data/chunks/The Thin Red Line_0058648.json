An Army division must be\ndiverted to support the Marines on Guadalcanal, an island\nwhich none of them is familiar with but which it appears is\nof critical importance in maintaining the supply route\nbetween the United States and Australia now in the first year\nof the war. The Army commanders tell him that two divisions\nare available; each is already at sea. The choice of which to\ndeploy is his and, after a few seconds of hesitation, he\nmakes it. He asks them to return to him some day in the\nfuture and to tell him, since he must remain far from the\nfighting, about their experience in the ordeal to come.\nSoldiers in the Civil war,.he says, spoke of “seeing the\nElephant”: it was as though in combat a strange, awesome\ncreature would appear, whose features one could not quite\ndescribe to anyone who had not seen it for himself.

Witt is just as glad, in his own\nway. All his friends are in C-for-Charlie, and he likes the\nreputation he enjoys here.

There is an ant-like scramble on the\nlittle spur, as everyone tries to hit the dirt on the slope\naway from the surprise. Private Mazzi, if not the foremost\n\nis certainly not the last among them.

He makes a\nhandsome picture of a soldier for the 2nd Platoon men who\nwatch him. Then he is up and running. Some bullets kick up\ndirt to right and left. He zigs and zags. Finally, just ahead\nof him, he sees a hand and arm shoot up into the air, the\nhand describing the old circular hand-and-arm signal for\n\"Gather here.\" Doll pulls up to find Queen lying placidly on\nhis side and grinning up at him ruefully, his rifle hugged\nagainst his chest.\n\nQUEEN\nCome right in.\n\nEXT. SECOND FOLD TO THIRD FOLD - DAY\n\nStein begins to move forward. Patches of flesh on his face\ntwitch uncontrollably. From behind the third swell he will\nmount the attack and observe it too. He wonders if the men\ncan tell his nerves are wearing thin. In the first place he\ncan never be sure that what he is doing is right, might not\nbe done better and with less cost in some other way. Danger\nflickers and blinks in the air like a faulty neon tube.\nWhenever he stands up he might be struck by a bullet\nWhenever he moves a few feet he might be moving under a\ndescending mortar shell.\n\nHe is turning these things over in his mind when Fife holds\nthe phone up to his ear.

Rifle and MG\nFIRE hit the ground all around him, but nothing touches him,\nand he arrives among them a hero. Everyone within reach slaps\nhim on the back as he makes his way to Stein to give his\nreport.\n\nDALE\nThey’re okay. 3rd Platoon's\noccupied the ridge on the left.\n\nStein sees a lone figure hurry toward him.

Four men of McCron’s squad go down at once. On the\nright, a young draftee named Wynn is shot in the throat and\nscreams, \"Oh, my God!\" in a voice of terror and disbelief as\na geyser of blood spurts from his neck.

So far Dale has not fired a shot. what\nis the point, when there are no targets? But now, seeing the\nemplacement, he carefully releases his safety and FIRES a\nlong burst with his Thompson gun, straight into the hole\ntwenty yards away. Before he can release the trigger the gun\njams solidly. But his burst is enough to stop the machine\ngun, at least momentarily, and Dale runs toward it pulling a\ngrenade from his shirt. From ten yards away he throws the\ngrenade like a baseball, wrenching hell out of his shoulder.\nThe grenade disappears through the hole, then BLOWS UP,\nscattering sticks and grass and three rag dolls and upending\nthe machine gun.

TALL\nGood man, my young exec... You'll\nprobably find the bunker guarded by\nsmaller MG posts around it. I think\nit is better to ignore these and go\nfor the strongpoint itself if you\npossibly can. The little posts will\nfall if the big one is taken.\nThat's all, gentlemen.

At first it appears no one is\nhurt, but then Storm is seen shaking his hand as though he'd\ntouched a hot stove. A single fragment, not much bigger than\na pinhead, has entered the back of his hand. Storm grins.\n\nSTORM\nI been wounded! I been wounded!\n\nWELSH\n(with a sneer)\nOkay. You'll get a Purple Heart.\n\nSTORM\nYou fucking A! And don't you forget\nto put me in. S’like a wasp sting.\nCaptain, when can I go to the rear?\nI mean, you know, I been wounded.\n\nHe raises his hand. When he flexes it, it makes a GRATING\nsound. Nobody says anything.

Gaff's little assault party crawls off to\nthe right along the ledge and disappears around the corner of\nthe hillside. Bell, at the head of the seven men, keeps\nthinking that he had only volunteered to lead a party back.\nIrritably, he glances back to motion the others to come on.\nWhen he reaches the point where he crawled out above the\nledge he stops. Sending Witt ahead, he points the place out\nto Gaff.\n\nWitt crawls out to take the point. Standing on his knees out\naway from the ledge, he holds his rifle ready with the safety\noff. He hasn't shot squirrel all his life for nothing; he\nhasn't made High Expert on the range for the past six years\nfor nothing, either.\n\nGAFF\n\nAny of you guys know how to operate\nthis thing?\n\n(the walkie-talkie; Bell\n\nnods)\nOkay, you stay below the ledge,\nI'll call down the data to you from\nup above. Once the 81s have\nplastered that rock as much as they\ncan, we'll crawl out along that low\nplace until we make a line, then\ncrawl up as close as we can through\nthe grass, then throw our grenades.\nOkay? Okay.\n\nGaff crawls out into the low place before the first shells\narrive. They can hear their soft SHU-SHU-SHU coming almost\nstraight down before they hit, then the hillside EXPLODES\ninto smoke and flame and noise.\n\f98.\n\nOnly fifty yards from the bunker, they are showered with a\nrain of dirt, chips of rock and small pieces of hot metal.\nThey cling to the ledge with their faces pressed against the\nsharp rock, cursing with hatred the goddamned fucking\nmortarmen because they might drop a short round, though they\ndon't.

As the elderly, morose 2nd lieutenant Gore climbs out\nfirst, he foolishly stands straight up, exposing himself to\nthe waist, whereupon a Japanese machine gunner immediately\nSHOOTS him three times trough the chest. Gingerly, they pull\nhim back down behind the ledge.\n\nDALE\nWhadda we do now? We can't take him\nwith us.\n\nWITT\n\nWe'll have to leave him.\n\nTHORNE\nYou can't leave him here.\n\nDALE\nOkay.

Sweating, lying pressed\nflat in an ecstasy of panic, terror, fear and cowardice, he\nsimply cannot stand it any longer. Wailing over and over ina\nhigh falsetto one word -- \"Mother! Mother!\" -- which\nfortunately nobody can hear, least of all himself, he leaps\nto his feet and begins to run straight at the Japanese\nemplacement, FIRING his rifle from his hip at the one\nembrasure he can see. As if startled beyond reasonable\nexpectation, most of the Japanese fire stops suddenly. At the\nsame moment, Capt. Gaff, released from his own temporary\npanic, leaps up waving his arm and shouts for the rest to\nfall back. With Gaff in the lead the rest of the assault\nforce runs for the trough and their lives. Meanwhile Doll\ncharges on, wailing his incantation: \"Mother! Mother!\"\n\nWhen his rifle is empty, he throws it at the embrasure, draws\nhis pistol and begins FIRING it. With his left hand he tears\na grenade from his belt, stops firing the pistol long enough\nto pull the pin with one finger, and lobs the grenade over\ninto the camouflaged roof of the emplacement, which he can\nnow see clearly since it is only about twenty yards away, and\nwhere the grenade EXPLODES uselessly and without effect.\nThen, continuing to FIRE the pistol, he charges on. Only when\nthe pistol ceases to fire for want of ammunition does he come\nto his senses and realize where he is.\n\nAstonished, he turns and runs. Luckily for Doll, he does not\nturn back toward the others but simply runs blindly off to\nthe right.

But when he falls he finds that there is nothing-\nunder him; he has fallen over the ledge. His foot stinging\npainfully, he bounces to the foot of the ledge, landing with\na bone-jarring THUD, then rolls another ten yards before he\ncan get himself stopped.\n\f102.\n\nEXT. LEDGE - DAY\n\nFor a while Doll just lies in the grass, breathing in groans\nbruised, sore, the wind knocked out of him, half-blinded. At\nthe moment all he can think about is that he wants to be with\npeople, so he can put his arms around somebody and they can\nput their arms around him. With this in mind, he gets up and,\ngrasping the ledge, runs gas pin back along it till he comes\nto the trough, where he almost runs head-on into the others,\nall sitting against the rock and gasping breathlessly. Only\none of them, Thorne, has been hurt, and he has had his\nshoulder smashed by an MG bullet. Capt. Gaff speaks before\nDoll can apologize, make excuses or explain away what he has\ndone.

CUT - BATTALION POSITION - DAY\n\nThe soldiers at C-for-Charlie's forward position watch and\nwait anxiously to see who will return with the assault party,\nif anyone returns at all. Queen chews his fingernails; the\ntension is unbearable. Suddenly, they hear the electrifying\nword: \"Witt!\" Other names follow: \"Doll... Dale...

I'm convinced\nthe toughest part will be the open\nspace between the end of the trough\nhere and the shoulder of the knob.\nOnce we get past that, it won't be\nso bad. Remember that we may run\ninto smaller emplacements along the\nway. I'd rather by-pass them if we\ncan, but we may have to knock them\nout. Okay, that's all. When we get\nup to them, we ought to have some\nfun.\n\nHe stops and smiles at them, looking each man in the eyes in\nturn: a happy, adventuresome smile. There are several weak\nsmiles in reply, similar to his own if not as strong. Only\nWitt's and Queen's seem to be really deep. But they are all\ngrateful to him. Since yesterday, all of them have come to\nlike him very much. He treats them like equals. They would\nfollow him anywhere.\n\nGAFF\nOnce we get through this mess and\nback down off the line, I promise\nyou the biggest drunk of your\nlives. My treat! I'll be leading\nfrom here on out. I want to pick\nthe route myself. If anything\nshould happen to me, Sergeant Bell\nwill be in command, so I want him\nlast. Sergeant Dale will be second\nin command. They both know what to\ndo.

Gore\ngot himself killed.\n\f118.\n\nGaff looks off toward the strongpoint, but without raising\nhis head high enough to see anything above the grass. Are\nthey waiting? Are they watching? Are they looking at this\nparticularly open spot? He cannot know.\n\nWith a sudden gasp, he bounces up and takes off with his\nrifle at high port, running agonizingly slowly and pulling\nhis knees up high to clear the matted kunai grass like a\nfootball player running through stacks of old tires. Not a\nshot is fired. He dives in behind the shoulder of the knob\nand lies there. After waiting a full minute, he motions the\nnext man, Queen, to come on. Queen takes off running in the\nsame way, the shotgun in his hands, his helmet straps\nflagging. Just before he reaches the shoulder, a single\nmachine gun OPENS UP, but he dives to safety. The machine gun\nSTOPS.\n\nThe third man, Doll, falls. He is only about five yards out\nwhen several MGs OPEN UP. They are watching this time. It is\nonly twenty yards across, the open space, but it seems much\nlonger. He is already breathing in ripping gasps. Then his\nfoot catches in a hole in the mat of old grass and he is\ndown. Oh, no! his mind screams at him in panic. Not me! Not\nafter all the rest that's happened to me! Blindly, spitting\ngrass seeds and dust, he clambers up and staggers on. He has\nten yards more to go, and he makes it.\n\nBut now all the MGs from the strongpoint are FIRING, hosing\ndown the trough itself, as well as the open space. BULLETS\ntear over the heads of Dale, Witt and Bell in bunches which\nRATTLE and bruise the thin bushes. It is now Dale's turn to\ngo, and he is furious.\n\nBELL\nHey, wait! Wait! Don't go yet!

Nothing has touched him.\n\nGAFF\nYou must be out of your mind!\n\nMaliciously, Dale settles in to see what Bell and Witt will\ndo now. Heh heh. Not that he wants them to get hurt or\nanything.\n\nBell demonstrates his idea immediately. When he and Witt have\ncrawled to the end of the trough, the MGs still FIRING just\n\nover their heads, Bell pulls the pin on a grenade and lobs it\nat the strongpoint. But he does not throw it straight across;\n\f119.\n\nhe throws it into the angle formed by the ledge and the\ntrough, so that it lands in front of the bunker but away\ntoward the ledge. when the MGs all swing that way, as they do\nimmediately, he and Witt cross in safety before they can\nswing back.\n\nClearly, the three of them could have done it just as easily,\nand when he throws himself down grinning in the safety behind\nthe shoulder, Bell winks at Charlie Dale again. Dale glowers\n\nback.\n\nEXT. KNOB AND SADDLE - DAY\n\nGaff said the rest of the route would be easier once they\nwere past the open space, and he is right. The terrain mounts\nsteeply around the knob which juts out of the ridge and up\nhere the mat of grass is not quite so thick, but now they are\nforced to crawl. It is next to impossible to see the\ncamouflaged emplacements until they open up, and they cannot\ntake any chances. They all know from yesterday that beyond\nthe knob is a shallow saddle between the knob and the rock\nwall where the ledge ends, and it is along this saddle which\nthey are to crawl to come down on the Japanese from above.\n\nWhen they reach the beginning of the saddle, sweating and\nhalf-dead from lack of water, Gaff motions them to stop. He\nhas to swallow his dry spittle several times before he can\nspeak. Remembering that the other platoons will charge at the\nsound of his whistle, he unhooks it from his pocket.\n\nGAFF\nI want to get as close to them as\nwe can before we put the grenades\nto them.",

JAPANESE STRONGPOINT (THE ATTACK) - DAY\n\nSlowly, as they crawl, the entire strongpoint becomes visible\n-- its nearer, right end only twenty-five yards away, and\nonly a very few yards below their own height. And it is just\nas they can finally see it, that they are discovered by the\nJapanese.\n\nFive scrawny, bedraggled Japanese men pop up out of the\nground holding dark round objects which they lob up the hill\nat them. Fortunately, only one of the five grenades EXPLODES.\n\f120.\n\nIt lights near Dale, who rolls over twice away from it and\nthen lies huddled as close to the ground as he can get, his\nface turned away. None of its fragments hit him, but it makes\nhis ears ring.\n\nGAFF\nPull and throw! Pull and throw!\n\nAlmost as one man, their six grenades arch at the\nstrongpoint. The five Japanese men who popped up out of the\nground have by now popped back down into it. But, as the\ngrenades light, two other, unlucky Japanese pop up to throw.\nOne grenade lights between the feet of one of these and\nEXPLODES up into him, blowing off one of his feet and putting\nhim down. Fragments put the other one down. All of the\nAmerican grenades EXPLODE.\n\nThe Japanese with his foot off lies still a moment, then\nstruggles up to sit, holding another grenade as the blood\npours from his severed leg. Doll SHOOTS him. He falls back\ndropping the ignited grenade beside him. It does not go off.\n\nGAFF\nAgain! Again!\n\nAgain six grenades arch in the air. This time there are four\nJapanese standing when the grenades light, one of them\ncarrying a light MG. The EXPLODING grenades put three of them\ndown, including the man with the Nambu, and the fourth,\nthinking better of it, disappears down a hole.\n\nGAFF\nGo in!\n\nIn a moment, all of them are on their feet running.",

In a moment, all of them are on their feet running. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n The\nJapanese have shrewdly taken advantage of the terrain to save\nthemselves digging work. Behind the holes into the\nemplacements themselves is a natural little low area where\nthey can come out and sit in cover when they are not actually\nbeing shelled. Now in this hollow the scrawny, bedraggled\nJapanese rise with rifles, swords and pistols from their\nholes to meet Gaff and his crew. At least, some of them do.\nOthers stay in the holes. Three try to run. Dale SHOOTS one\nand Bell SHOOTS another. The third disappears in a grand\nbroad jump over the edge of the rock face where it falls\nclear, sixty or eighty feet to the jungle treetops below. The\nothers come on. And Gaff and his troops, the Captain blowing\nhis whistle, run to meet them, in clear view of the rest of C-\nfor-Charlie down at the ledge below.\n\nQueen kills five men almost at once. His SHOTGUN blows the\nfirst nearly in two and tears enormous chunks out of the\nsecond and third.\n\f121.\n\nWhile he struggles to unsling the rifle from his back, he is\nattacked by a screaming officer with a sword. Gaff SHOOTS the\nofficer in the belly from the hip. Bell has killed two men\nand Dale two. Doll, who has drawn his pistol, is charged by\nanother screaming officer who shouts “Banzai!” over and over\nand who runs at him whirling his bright, gleaming sword\naround his head in the air. Doll SHOOTS him through the chest\nso that, in a strange, laughable way, his legs keep right on\nrunning while the rest of him falls down behind them.\n\nWitt peers into a cave. A bat flies out, startling him. A\nsoldier approaches with a flamethrower at the ready.\n\nWitt has SHOT three men, one of them a huge, fat sergeant\nwielding a black cavalry saber. Taking the overhead saber cut\non the stock of his rifle, cutting it almost to the barrel,\nWitt butt-strokes him in the jaw. Now he SHOOTS him where he\nlies.

It is then they hear the\nfirst SHOUTS from the other side, and remember they are not\nthe only living.\n\f122.\n\nGoing to the grassy bank, they see the same field they\nthemselves tried to cross last evening. Coming across it at a\nrun, the rest of C-for-Charlie is charging uphill toward the\nstrongpoint, according to Colonel Tall's plan, coming\nstraight at them, yelling.\n\nWhatever their reason, they are little late. The fight is\nalready over. Or so everyone thinks. Waving and cheering\nironically and hooting derision at the heroes, their\npretended rescuers, Gaff’s men are interrupted by the sound\nof a MACHINE GUN. Directly below them, in one of the\napertures, a single MG opens up and begins to FIRE at 2nd\nPlatoon. As Gaff’s men watch incredulously, two men go down.\nDale, who is standing nearest to the door of the embrasure\nwhich is FIRING, leaps over with a shocked look on his face\nand throws a grenade down the hole.

There is a YELL from\nbelow. Still FIRING, Witt pops the grenade down the hole and\nducks back. He continues to FIRE to confuse the occupants.\nThen the grenade blows up with a ROAR, cutting off both the\nscrabble of yells and the MG, which has never stopping\nfiring.\n\nImmediately, others of the little force, without any\nnecessity of orders from Gaff, begin bombing out the other\nfour holes using Witt’s technique: one man FIRING while\nanother tosses the grenades. They BOMB them all, whether\nthere is anybody in them or not. There is a joyous feeling in\nthe safety of killing. Slapping each other on the back and\ngrinning at each other murderously, they call to the C-for-\nCharlie men below to come on.\n\nColonel Tall appears at the top of the embankment, followed\nby Captain Stein.

Joyously, Fife\nsteps in again and left-hooks him. This time it is more\naccurate, and on the jaw. It sends Weld rolling away wildly\nto the ground, where he props himself on his elbows, shaking\nhis head. When he rolls over to sit up, Fife dives on him.\n\nIt is as though a sudden scrambled lightning bolt of happy\nmaleness and joyous masculinity has g lit Fife's skull,\nblinding him with glory. On top of the groggy Weld on the\nground, he cuffs and pummels. Growling and cursing high in\nhis throat and crying \"Job stealer!\" over and over, he\npunches with both fists and total abandon at the face below\nhim.

JUNGLE (MOWBRAY/GUADALCANAL )- DAY\n\nWitt is walking down a road through the jungle, humming to\nhimself, when he hears the SNAP of a spent bullet in leaves\noverhead. He stops and looks up. There is the faint, angry\nWHIRR of a second bullet. He looks up and down. He is quite\nalone here, exposed and vulnerable.\n\nEXT. JUNGLE (OTHER ANGLES) - DAY\n\nHe sees a group of flying foxes, stirring uneasily in their\nroost. He sees a stranger fig, choking the life out of a tall\nhardwood.

Now MUSIC comes\nin, like a call of summoning love.\n\nFurther up the road he encounters a Marine SNIPER.\n\nEXT. COPRA PLANTATION - DAY\n\nC-for-Charlie is camped by an abandoned copra plantation.

Or are you still not\nspeakin’ to me?\n\nWitt grins back. He seems to sense some change he likes. They\nare alone on the plantation's dusty veranda.

COPRA PLANTATION - DAY\n\nWitt looks at the other men, in the same ecstasy of loving\ncomradeship that he felt for Capt. Stein the afternoon of\ntheir assault on the Japanese bivouac.

Gracious, noble, she looks out on those\nscenes, a smile on her lips. She might be some individual\nwhom Witt has known; his sister or mother. She is all that is\nnot strife or war or senseless death. She is peace, she is\nhope.\n\nSHARP CUT TO:\n\nEXT COPRA PLANTATION - DAY\n\nA Japanese mortar BURSTS overhead. Fife quakes with horror.\n\f180.\n\nVOICE\nNot my legs! Not my legs!\n\nDOLL\nCheck your ammo!\n\nC-for-Charlie cringes under a fierce counterattack. The\nJapanese heavy mortars are lobbing in treebursts, and there\nis nowhere to hide. From time to time a man rises up to draw\na piece of coconut tree from his flesh; the fragments are\nthrown down from above with the force of the shrapnel itself\nand finally do more damage.\n\nAnimals rush through the trees and across the tangled bungle\nfloor, as though fleeing a fire.

COPRA PLANTATION - DAY\n\nThe company's sparrow-mouthed, long-nosed NEW LIEUTENANT\ngives the phone back to Corporal Weld. Neither he nor anyone\nelse seems to have the least idea where the enemy is or what\nis going or. Half a dozen men from another unit flee past\nthem, some without their helmets.

DESERTED ROAD - DAY\nThe three volunteers make their way forward.\n\nWITT\nYou never know when to keep your\nmouth shut.\n\nWitt studies the road ahead from the position they have taken\nup alongside it. Fife trembles. He wants to weep, but he is\nafraid to. Everything is going so fast, so far. For a moment\nnothing happens. Then, ominously, the mortars fall silent.\nFife feels it again -- the cold, empty fear -- like a hollow,\na void, where his confidence once lay his pleasure in\nhimself. It makes him feel sick. And it stays with him.\n\nWitt looks around. A NOISE in the undergrowth on their right\nbarely perceptible at first, gradually grows more distinct.\n\nCoombs peers forward, alarmed by a FAINT CRY. Ignoring Fife,\nhe looks at Witt only. Witt says nothing.\n\nCoombs raises his head again. The concussion of a late mortar\nround sends him reeling.\n\nAll at once, fifty yards ahead of them, they see a whole\nbattalion of Japanese soldiers materialize from the tree\nline.\n\f184.\n\nHundreds of fresh troops appear, camouflaged with the\nbranches of trees and bushes -- nothing like the gaunt,\nstarving, poorly-equipped figures C-for-Charlie has\nencountered prior to now. The American soldiers look more\nemaciated than the Japanese do.\n\nWitt sees they have no chance of getting back together. Calm\nand with a curious air of concentration, he turns to Fife.\n\nWITT\nGo back. Tell them what we saw. Say\nthey're coming up right behind the\nmortars. Battalion strength.\n\nFIFE\nWhy me? Let's both go.\n\nWitt thinks about it for a moment. The Japanese advance\nquickly, silently; this will be a surprise attack.\n\nWITT\nThere's no time. You go.

DESERTED ROAD - DAY\n\nWitt waits until the Japanese are practically on top of him\nbefore he OPENS FIRE. They are caught by surprise. Clearly\nthey had not expected to meet resistance so soon. A small\nJapanese soldier with a .31 Caliber machine gun strapped to\nhis back advances toward him. He cannot reach back and fire\nthe gun himself; his job is merely to serve as a tripod for\nit. Seeing Witt, he throws himself on the ground and digs in\nlike a badger. Other Japanese soldiers dash forward to\nsqueeze the trigger. One by one Witt shoots them down;\nquickly, decisively, with daring and skill. Soon mortar\nrounds begin to fall among the enemy soldiers. He looks back\nover his shoulder. Perhaps Fife has reported their position;\nperhaps the Japanese will stop and he'll get out of this.\n\nEXT.

None is bold\nenough to challenge the huge veteran.\n\nQueen stares into the face of one of the prisoners, a man\nhalf his size. The Japanese is dazed and exhausted.

As he is going\nout the flap Doc Haines calls out to him.\n\nDoc HAINES\nYou're a sergeant now, I see. You\nwere a corporal before, weren't\nyou?\n\nFife nods.\n\nEXT. EXAMINING TENT - DAY\n\nOutside the tent Bell slaps him on the back. Fife tries to\nlook joyful -- Bell seems to expect it -- but somehow he\ncannot. Things are going so fast. Already a new destiny is\nupon him.\n\nEXT. SUPPLY AREA - DAY\n\nFife and Bell sit on a packing crate in a supply area.\n\nBELL\nHow can you even think twice about\nit?\n\nFIFE\n\nI got my squad.

They have just broken off for noon chow, and\nCorporal Weld has come around with a batch of new mail. When\nhe opens it and sees how it begins, he knows what it is. She\nhas been doing it.
