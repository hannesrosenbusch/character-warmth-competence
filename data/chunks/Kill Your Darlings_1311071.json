LECTURE HALL - DAY\n\n\n\nPatrician, old-guard PROFESSOR STEEVES lectures on the first\n\nday of class, Allen dutifully taking notes in his journal. 10. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n                    PROFESSOR STEEVES\n\n          Rhyme, meter, conceit. Without this\n\n          balance, a poem becomes slack,\n\n          sloppy. An untucked shirt.\n\n\n\nAllen disagrees and raises his hand.\n\n\n\n                    ALLEN\n\n          Professor Steeves, then how do you\n\n          explain Whitman?\n\n\n\nNo one interrupts Professor Steeves. Murmurs from around the\n\nclass. Steeves locks down his gaze on Allen.\n\n\n\n                    PROFESSOR STEEVES\n\n          Say more. Two more sentences.\n\n\n\n                    ALLEN\n\n          He hated rhyme and meter. The whole\n\n          point was untucking your shirt.\n\n\n\nProfessor Steeves smiles to himself.

Your father perhaps is\n\n          the poet Louis Ginsberg?\n\n\n\nAllen nods.\n\n\n\n                    PROFESSOR STEEVES\n\n          He writes rhyming, metered verse.\n\n          Why do you think he chose that\n\n          form?\n\n\n\nAll eyes on Allen.\n\n\n\n                    ALLEN\n\n          Because it's easier.\n\n\n\nThe class titters. Professor Steeves hushes them.\n\n\n\n                    PROFESSOR STEEVES\n\n          This university exists because of\n\n          tradition and form. Would you\n\n          rather this building be built by\n\n          engineers or Whitman and his boys\n\n          at play?\n\n                                                          11.\n\n\n\n\n\nAllen, realizing he is trapped, unable to answer. Professor\n\nSteeves smiles victoriously and writes on the blackboard.\n\n\n\n                     PROFESSOR STEEVES\n\n          There can be no creation before\n\n          imitation.\n\n\n\nThe other students take note. Allen sighs, follows suit. From\n\nthe back row, Lucien watches Allen and unsheathes a grin.\n\n\n\n\n\nINT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT\n\n\n\nLuke, dressed in a suit, puts on cologne.
