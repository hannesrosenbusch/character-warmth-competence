Have the words \"THE\n\n       BLAST\" come out of the flame. Then there is a SLIGHT\n\n       EXPLOSION and the flame intensifies. The words \"FROM THE\n\n       PAST\" jump out of the exhaust as the jet momentarily\n\n       shakes.\n\n\n\n       INT. JET\n\n\n\n       The PILOT feels the jet shake.

Adam and Helen\n\n       come in to offer cocktails to Troy and Eve.\n\n\n\n                           EVE (VO)\n\n                 Whenever Adam gives me such obviously\n\n                 incorrect information, I just smile,\n\n                 slap him on the knee, and look out the\n\n                 window.\n\n                 Why spoil his dreams?  They're such\n\n                 wonderful dreams.\n\n\n\n       The CAMERA wanders off of them and shoots out the glass\n\n       doors. We see Calvin behind the house...measuring off the\n\n       dimensions for a fallout shelter.\n\n\n\n       EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\n\n\n\n       Calvin continues to measure as we pull way back and up.\n\n       Perry Como sings \"We'll Meet Again\".\n\n\n\n                                                          FADE OUT:\n\n\n\n                           THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
