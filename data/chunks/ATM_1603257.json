People work into the night.\n\nThe wall clock reads 7:14PM.\n\nDavid sits at his desk, talking on the phone. Or, better\ndescribed, being talked to.\n\nHis tie unloosened, his hair mussed, he fails in his efforts\nto keep stress at bay.\n\nDAVID\n(into phone)\nRight...I understand.

She looks back at him. Their gaze holds for a\nmoment, but then they both look away.\n\nCOREY\nIt was the pizza guy. So, I tell\nhim, “You better not be charging me\nfor this. I ordered the fucking\nthing last year!”\n\nThe punchline receives a few courtesy chuckles.\n\nLUKE\nDid you end up paying?\n\nCOREY\nNo. The kid apologized and --\n\nAs Corey plops back down into his seat, Corey accidentally\nbangs into the table and knocks his iPhone onto the floor.\nHe doesn’t notice.\n\nHe also spills everyone's drinks.

STREET - SECONDS LATER\n\nCars and taxis speed past. Their exhaust mixes with the cold\nair, clouding up the street.\n\nEmily walks from the bar and is instantly hit by an achingly\ncold gust of wind. She extends a shivering arm to signal a\ncab, but it passes her by.\n\nDavid exits the bar, carrying a winter hat. Catches up to\nher.\n\nDAVID\nEmily, wait...\n\nEmily turns to face who called her.

She grows frustrated. Cold. She\nmoves to a spot further down the street. David walks with\nher.\n\nDAVID\nWe've talked plenty of times\nbefore.\n\nWearing only his button-down work shirt, the cold is already\ntaking its toll on David. He folds his arms for warmth.\nTries to rub life back into his limbs.\n\nEMILY\nAt work, yeah. You’d call me at my\ndesk, ask me about a financial\nreport, but that was it.\n\nDAVID\nI never cared about the reports.\n\nThey smile at each other. Their breath escapes into the cold\nnighttime air.\n\nA cab speeds past. Emily misses the chance to signal it.\nStanding in the spot she stood moments ago are two women.\nThe cab stops for them and they climb in.\n\nEMILY\n(re: the missed cab)\nDamn it...\nA bone-chilling gust of wind blows through. Emily clutches\nher coat closer to her chest and neck. David turns away\nslightly, letting the brunt of the wind hit his back.\nOnce it passes:\n\nDAVID\nI can give you a ride home.\n\nEmily considers it, but then:\nEMILY\nI live outside the city. It’s\nreally out of the way.\nAnother cab passes without stopping.\nDAVID\nCome on, it’s freezing out here.\nI‘1l grab my jacket and we'll go.\n\nMore cold wind blows through. It chills them to the bone.\n\f13.\n\nEMILY\nThat would be great. Thanks.\n\nHe hurries back toward the bar. Emily yells over to him.\nEMILY (CONT'D)\nYou should probably return that\nhat.\nINT.
