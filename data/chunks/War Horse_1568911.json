We fly\n\n          low over the high, thick hedges untouched for hundreds of\n\n          years. The thick verdant countryside in all its splendor,\n\n          ancient woodlands, fields of corn, and finally a paddock in a\n\n          typical Devonshire dale.\n\n                         \n\n          We come to rest beside three farmers standing over a pregnant\n\n          mare. The mare is in distress - she is about to give birth.\n\n          The farmers calm the mare and tend to her gently with\n\n          assurance and authority.\n\n                         \n\n          We pull back to see, ALBERT, a fifteen-year-old farm boy,\n\n          watching the whole drama with delight from the paddock gate.\n\n                         \n\n                          FARMER\n\n           Come on, easy, girl.

Both Joey and his mother instinctively canter over to\n\n          the two men, expecting food. The three men gently greet the\n\n          horses and pet them, then we see one man has a noose made of\n\n          a rope. He slips it round Mum's neck. She pulls back, Joey is\n\n          shaken and bewildered but before he knows what's happening\n\n          the second farmer is trying to get a similar rope around his\n\n          neck. Joey balks and pushes the farmer aside, distressed to\n\n          see his mother tethered. The farmer grabs Joey again and\n\n          struggles with him, enlisting the help of the second farmer.\n\n          With some effort they get the rope around his neck and calm\n\n          him down.\n\n                         \n\n                          FARMER 2\n\n           Easy does it.
