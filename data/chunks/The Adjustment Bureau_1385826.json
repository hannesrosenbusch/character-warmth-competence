BUS -- MORNING\n\n\n\n          David enters the Ml bus. He feeds his Metrocard into the\n\n          reader as he looks down the aisle scanning the riders.. .more\n\n          out of habit than actual hope.

She walks like Elise. She's dressed in the same\n\n          eclectic style. He slams the red \"next stop\" strip, jumps\n\n          to his feet, and runs to the front of the bus.\n\n\n\n                         DAVID\n\n          Stop the bus.\n\n\n\n                         DRIVER\n\n          The next stop--\n\n\n\n                         DAVID\n\n          Now.\n\n\n\n          EXT.
