They are wearing rush hats, deerskin hunting wear,\nand leather arm protectors, and are carrying quivers on their\nbacks.\n\nThe Samurai in the lead, old but tough, draws his bow, aiming\nat the prey. His long white hair and beard billow in the\nwind; his hawkish eyes shine in his tanned face - the\nmagnificent vision of a great warrior who has survived\nhundreds of battles. This is the Great Lord, Hidetora\nIchimonji.\n\nEXTERIOR - PLATEAU - DAY\n\nA three-forked road - two forks split to right and left\ntoward the mountains on the edge of the plateau, the other to\nthe great expanse of the plain below. By the three roads are\nthree camps, each with a different family crest indicating\nthe owner on the bunting. Stationed by the respective camps\nare retainers and beaters. The horses graze, their bodies\ngleaming with sweat.\n\nEXTERIOR - ICHIMONJI CAMP - DAY\n\nThe family crest of Ichimonji, a figure meaning “one,” is on\nthe bunting.\n\nEXTERIOR - INCHIMONJI CAMP - DAY\n\nA circle of lords and retainers seated comfortably around\nsaké and food, enjoying the feast.

Those with the\nbodies of Saburo and Hidetora resume their advance.\n\nTwilight creeps to the field, darkening the figures of these\nhumans who have seen hell in this world. The glow of the\nevening is as red as blood, slowly paling, giving way to\ndusk. Azusa Field is beginning to disappear under the cloak\nof evening.\n\nFar beyond the field, upon the stone walls of the remains of\nAzusa Castle, a small figure is seen.\n\f193A\n\n193B\n\n103.\n\nEXTERIOR - REMAINS OF AZUSA CASTLE - STONE WALL - SUNSET\n\nTsurumaru wanders alone, cane in hand. His cane knocks at the\nstones at the top of the wall, then finds nothing further.\nSurprised, he steps back. The scroll falls from his hand,\nrolls down the high wall of the donjon, opens, and lands on\nthe grass in the empty moat.\n\nThe picture of the Amitabha, torn in places, shines golden in\nthe last light from the darkening sky. The face of the\nAmitabha looks sad as it gazes at the upper side of the wall.\nEXTERIOR - AZUSA FIELD - SUNSET\n\nOn top of the steep stone wall, Tsurumaru is at a loss.\n\nThe evening glow is now in its final stages. The last light\nof day will soon fade, and darkness will reign over the\nrealm.\n\nAgainst the background of the last glow of evening, the small\nfigure of Tsurumaru is standing alone on the lofty stone wall\n\nin the remains of the castle.\n\nWretchedness!\n\nTHE END\n\f"
