I’m going to\ntry my luck out west.\n\nTRACY\nYou're going today? On\nThanksgiving?\n\nBROOKE\nNew York isn’t the New York I used\nto know. There’s too much\nconstruction.

Like, financially?\n\nBROOKE\nYeah. Mamie-Claire gave me what\nwould have been my share of our T-\nshirt profits. It was just enough\nto pay off my debts and get out of\ntown.\n\nTRACY\nWhat will you do in LA?\n\nBROOKE\nI don’t know. I think I’m sick.\nAnd I don’t know if my ailment has\na name - it’s just me sitting and\nstaring at the internet or the\ntelevision for long periods of time\ninterspersed by trying to not do\nthat and then lying about what I’ve\nbeen doing.
