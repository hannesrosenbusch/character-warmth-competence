Most\nof the people in town, particularly those in better eireumstances,\nhave built houses away from the street, end some of them even have\nsmall lawns and flower patches, most of them rather pathetic.\n\nBetween the station and the hotel are to be found the\nmajority of the settings for the action of the story: the Marshal's\noffice and the courtroom, the Ramirez Bar, the barber shop, the\ngeneral store, the livery stable. Other establishments that should\nbe indicated but will not be used (as of this writing) will be in\ntune with the place and period: «a bank, restaurants, rooming houses,\na millinery shop, a hand laundry, etc. Almost all the buildings\nalong the street have some kind of structures behind them, such as\nouthouses or sheds or, in some cases, Living quarters.\n\nNot so long ago, Hadleyville, Like many other frentier\ntowns that vere at the mercy of nearby feudal barons, had been\nterrorized by Gil Jordan and his retainers. From his ranch, Gil\nJordan had ruled Hadleyville, and ruled {t ruthlessly and eruelly.\nThere are still men == and women, too =~ who bear the physical marks\nof Jordan's maniacal rages, Five years ago, hovever, Marshal Will\nDoane, backed by a half a dozen harderiding deputies, had broken\nthe Jordan gang and arrested Jordan for murder.",

Now, five years later, Hadleyville is a safe place for vomen\nand children. Law end order have been so firmly established that\nDoane new has only two deputies.\n\nTHE PEOPLE are MARSHAL WILL DOANE, HELEN RAMIREZ,\nAMY DOANE, HARVEY PELL and others.\n\nWILL DOANE is in his middle thirties. Adequately\neducated, he is a second-generation westerner in a land thet is\nstill spreading out. Like most of the other citizens of Hadleyvilie,\nhe is not a native of the town.

Some tvo years ago be had a somewhat Lengthy affair with:\n\nHELEN RAMIREZ. She is two or three years older than\nDoane, a victim of an era and environment vith rigid social stand-\nards.

After his death she hed become Gil Jordan's mistress,\nWith Jordan in jail for Lite, Helen had herself selected Will Deane\nas his successor, and Helen still cannot forgive Doane for ending\nthe lisscn, for this is a priviledge she reserves for herselr.\nRecently, she had allowed herself to drift into an affair with\nHarvey Pell, Doane's friend end deputy. A good business women, she\nbas long since disposed of her interest in the Ramirez saloon, ent\nds a silent partner in the town's general store.\n\nAMY DOANE is, withoyt kmowing it, one of the new vomen\nof the period, women who are beginning to rebel against the Limit-\nations ani restrictions of the Victorian epoch. Young, attractive,\niirtelligemt, strong-willed, Amy is determined not to be a sheltered\ntoyewife but @ full partner in her merciage, and it is she who has\nPlanned their future. More, Amy has strong emotional emi intellectual.\nconvictions against any form of violence, because ber father and\nbrothers vere killed while taking part in Vigilante action, end\nshe has since embraced the Quaker faith. Marziage to Doane would\nhave been unthinkable had he remained a peace officer.\n\nHARVEY PELL is younger than Deane, his deputy and friend.\nBut beneeth that friendship is a nagging sense of inferiority and an\nenvy of Deane. Thus, although he has secretly taken Doane's place\nas Helen's lover, he has a feeling that he has oot really replaced\nDeane. In addition, Harvey is ambitious, amicus to preve his manhood\nacd importance. He bas hoped to be appointed Mersbel in Doane's\nPlace, ami he has expected that Deane would secure the position for\nhim.

He has been a\npeace officer all his life, but age and the arthritis that has\ncrippled his hands have caused his retirement some years before,\n\nMILT JORDAN, Gil's younger brother, JAMES PIERCE and\nJACK COLBY are all that remain of the Jordan bunch.
