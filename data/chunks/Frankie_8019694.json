QUINTA DE SAO THIAGO/PAUL’S ROOM - DAY 1\n\n \n\nWe are in a simple, small but comfortable hotel room with\nbare white walls and worn out but well-kept hardwood floors.\nThere’s a small bed with someone seemingly asleep in it; a\ndesk and a chair in the corner. Around the window, we see a\nfaint frame of early morning light, but the curtains are\ndrawn closed, keeping the room dark and tranquil.\n\nAfter a few seconds, we notice a quiet but steady sound\n“drip... drip... drip...\" breaking the absolute silence.\n\nOn the bed, PAUL GAGNE has his eyes open, awake in the\ndarkness. A light-haired Frenchman in his mid 30’s, he\nlistens to the steady beat of water falling one drop after\nthe next into a lonesome metal can.\n\nHe can hear a piano start to play in the distance.\n\nEXT. STREETS/SINTRA - DAY 2\n\nIt’s morning of a Fall day in Sintra, the ancient Portuguese\ncity on the hills, not far from Lisbon. For centuries, this\nwas the summer retreat for the local aristocracy. The ornate\ntowers of various castles, each in its own architectural\nstyle, are seen above the more typical Colonial-era buildings\nthat make up the heart of the town. There’s green all around\nfrom its famous lush gardens. The effect is romantic - almost\nfairy tale.\n\nThe streets are still quiet in town. It’s early in the\nmorning. The tour buses have not yet arrived. The lucky\ntourists who managed to get a room in town are still asleep.\nWell, not all of them.",

Looking down, hands in his pockets, he is deep in\nthought. It’s a beautiful day in Sintra, but Jimmy is unaware\nof his magnificent surroundings.\n\nEXT. FONTE DOS NOIVADOS/SINTRA - DAY 3\n\n \n\nAs Jimmy turns the corner, something makes him slow down.\nIt’s nothing more than an old fountain adorned with beautiful\ntile work. He stops to listen to the sound of the working\nfountain and, as if hit by a wave of nostalgia, he slowly\napproaches the water stream. And as Jimmy touches the water,\nhis eyes fill up with tears.\n\nTIAGO (0.S.)\nWe call that Fonte dos Noivados -\nThe Engagement Fountain.\n\fEXT. OVERLOOK/SINTRA - DAY 4\n\nStanding on top of a sloped street, an elegant older man with\nsilver hair, adjusts his BINOCULARS, trying to get the scene\ndown below, of Jimmy at the fountain, into focus.\n\nThe friendly looking Frenchman in his early 60's is MICHEL\nGAGNE. Next to him is TIAGO MIRANTE, a striking, young\nPortuguese guide.\n\nTIAGO (0.S.)\nThe tile work is from the late 18th\nCentury, from the reign of Dona\nMaria I. At that time, unmarried\ngirls would come from all over the\nregion to drink from this ancient\nfountain. They’d do this pilgrimage\nbecause there was a belief that the\nwaters would help them find a good\nhusband.\n\nMichel lets his binoculars fall to his chest, and hang from\ntheir straps.\n\nMICHEL\nAnd did it work?\n\nTIAGO\nThey say so.\n\nMICHEL\nHow magnificent. If only it was so\neasy.\n\nTiago smiles benignly, then starts down the street, watched\nby Michel.\n\nMICHEL\n\n(to himself)\nMagnifique.\n\nEXT.

As if part of a ritual, she then\nsplashes water on the back of her neck. Once, twice.\n\nFrankie gets up and, meditative, keeping her eyes down at the\nwater, takes a deep breath. She’s a striking woman, with a\nvery short haircut, messy like a boy’s, accentuating her\nstrong features.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nMAYA, 15, light-skinned black, in shorts and a tank top, is\nlying on a lounge chair by the pool reading Wuthering\nHeights.

QUINTA DE SAO THIAGO/IAN & SYLVIA’S SUITE - DAY 7\n\n \n\nIAN ANDOH, 46, an Englishman, black, solidly built, sits on\nthe bed, wearing shorts, holding a running shoe. He tries to\nput the shoe on, but it’s too tight. He picks it up again,\nand as he loosens up the shoe laces, working meticulously\nfrom the top part down, a recurring thought manifests itself.\n\nIAN\nThe whole thing is so unfair. I\ncan’t get over it. They’re one of\nthe happiest, most perfectly\nromantic pairs I have ever known.\n\nIan’s wife SYLVIA ANDOH, late 30's, stands across the hotel\nsuite, dressed in pants and a bra, picking up a shirt from an\nopen suitcase. They must have been a happy couple at some\npoint. Now, approaching middle age, something sets them\napart.\n\nSYLVIA\nThere’s no perfection there.
