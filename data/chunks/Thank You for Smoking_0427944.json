What did you do?\n\nNICK\nI informed the public of all the research\nperformed in the investigation on the\neffects of tobacco.\n\nFINISTIRRE\nAnd what, so far, has the Academy\nconcluded in the investigation on the\neffects of tobacco?\n\f105.\n\nNICK\nWell, many things actually.

We’re here to\nexamine the possibility of a warning\nlogo on cigarettes. Now, Mr. Naylor, I\nhave to ask out of formality, do you\nbelieve that smoking cigarettes over\ntime can lead to lung cancer and other\nrespiratory conditions such as\nemphysema?\n\nFinistirre rolls his eyes.

Nick continues.\n\nNICK\nAnd here comes Senator Finistirre, whose\nfine state is, I regret to say, clogging\nthe nation’s arteries with Vermont\ncheddar cheese.

Perhaps Vermont\ncheddar should come with a skull and\ncrossbones.\n\nFINISTIRRE\nYou little...\n\nLothridge covers Finistirre’s mic so we don’t hear the word,\n“shit”. Finistirre is fuming.

It is every\nparents’ job to warn their children of\nall the dangers of the world, including\ncigarettes. So one day, when they get\nolder, they can make an educated choice.\nNot to be corny, but that is what this\ncountry is supposed to be all about.

You’re sticking\nwith tobacco?\nNICK\n(smiles, then...)\n\nSmoking is a personal freedom that is\n\nenjoyed by countless Americans, and\n\nalthough I cannot smoke anymore due to my\n\ninjurious kidnapping, I believe in\n\nprotecting all freedoms...\nMeanwhile, as Nick continues, we take a look at JOEY.
