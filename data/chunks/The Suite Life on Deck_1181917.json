LSAT TESTING FACILITY - AFTERNOON\n\nWe open on a sign in large letters, “30 MINUTES LEFT.” As a\nhand replaces “30” with “15;\"” REVEAL a large room filled with\ncollege students furiously racing to finish the LSAT test.\n\nWe pan across to the one figure who seems unfazed. MIKE ROSS\n(Mets hat, short-hair, glasses, goatee) has already finished\nand is doodling on the back of the test.\n\nMike notices a PROCTOR walk by, looking at him curiously. He\nquickly turns the test over and pretends to nervously work on\nit. We speed up time as the “MINUTES LEFT” sign goes from\n“10” to “5\" to 4,3,2,1. Finally the proctor yells:\n\nPROCTOR\nTime’s up. Pencils down.\n\nMike blends in with the students and tosses his test on the\npile. As he leaves, the proctor moves the pile to the side,\nleaving Mike’s test on top, then he taps Mike from behind.\n\nPROCTOR\nExcuse me. Do I know you from somewhere?\n\nWe see anxiety momentarily cross Mike’s face. He swallows,\nthen turns around to see the Proctor looking at him intently.\n\nMIKE\nI don’t think so. I have a very good\nmemory for faces.\n\nThe Proctor shrugs, he must be wrong. Mike walks away. The\nProctor hesitates, thinks to himself, then turns to pick up\nMike’s test; the pile’s knocked over, no way to tell which is\nthe one he wants. He turns back; no Mike. He yells...\n\nPROCTOR\nHey!\n\nHe fights through a group of students to get out the door...\nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LSAT TEST - CONTINUOUS\n\nMike’s just outside the door. He breaks into a run around\nthe corner to a door at the end of the hall. No good, jammed\n\nwith students, he won’t have time to get through. As he runs\nto his right, he trips over a GUY WEARING A METS SHIRT.",

MEN’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nMike is in a stall. Without his Mets cap, his hair comes\ndown to his shoulders. He quickly removes his glasses and\nthe fake goatee he had on and flushes them. He exits the\nstall, looking 100% different than he did seconds ago...\n\nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MEN’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nA transformed Mike walks back down the hall with confidence.\nHe doesn’t break stride as the proctor runs by without even\nnoticing his existence. A small smile crosses his face...\nINT. A SMALL APARTMENT - LATER\n\nMike knocks on the door of an apartment. It opens. The\n\nYOUNG MAN looks exactly like Mike did at the LSAT’s.
