PALM DESERT - MORNING (D12) 701\n\nThe sun is almost up. Smog clearing. A small PRIVATE PLANE\ncomes in for a landing.\n\nEXT. AIRFIELD - MOMENTS LATER (D12) 702\n\nAs the plane touches down, we see A BLACK SUV, A THUG on a\nMOTORCYCLE (we'll call him PONCH), and two other men\nawaiting.\n\nAs the three men on the ground look on, the plane taxis to a\nstop, kills its engine. Silence, then --\n\nWe hear SOMETHING - is that MUSIC? Ever so faint. It sounds\na little like Pantera’s “Cowboys from Hell.” The bodyguards\nturn to see --\n\nAcross the airfield, in the distance - TAYLOR'S CAR.\nScreaming towards them. And we can really start to hear it\nnow, the PANTERA.\n\nWe stay behind THE BODYGUARDS as they raise SCOPED ASSAULT\nRIFLES; shoulder them. The car shrieks closer. The\nbodyguards take AIM and FIRE off a volley of shots.\n\nBLAM. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM.\n\nThe CAR gets HIT! It flips over several times, lands on its\nside in the dirt, a couple hundred yards away.\n\nThe bodyguards and Ponch look to each other, as, BEHIND\nTHEM --\n\nA bodyguard emerges from the plane, holds the door open\nfor...CRISTOBAL SIFUENTES. He looks intimidating, but\nthere's something about his demeanor that's a little Zen.\n\nCRISTOBAL\nThat was a rough one. I hate these\nlittle planes. Guys! You're not gonna\nbelieve this. The pilot is from the\nsame village as my grandfather in\nBolivia - fucking crazy right?\n\nThen...he sees the cloud of dust billowing from the crashed\ncar.\n\n(CONTINUED )\n\f702\n\n703\n\n704\n\n705\n\nBARRY - 107 - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 2.",
