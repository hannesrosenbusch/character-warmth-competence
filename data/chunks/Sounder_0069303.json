HUNTING WOODS - LANDSDOWN COUNTY - NIGHT \n\nIt is a clear but cold Autumn night at some time in the nineteen thirties. The \nLandsdown Woods are an assortment of various elements of nature: quiet water \nstreams, rushing rivers, heavy brushland, small trees, and the more dominant, \ngreat tall pines. NATHAN LEE MORGAN, a Black man in his late thirties or \nearly forties, treks deep into the woods with his eleven year old son, DAVID \nLEE, and his hound dog, SOUNDER. NATHAN LEE is a well built, strong manner of \na man with a deliberate and quiet manner - DAVID LEE, like his father is tall \nand strong with big, bright active eyes. SOUNDER, their hound dog, is a \nmixture of red-bone hound and bulldog, with great square jaws.\n\nTITLES BEGIN\n\nNATHAN LEE carries an old rifle, and a burlap sack thrown across his shoulder \n-- DAVID LEE walks with a lantern as SOUNDER tracks ahead of them. They keep \nmoving until they come upon a quiet river stream --\n\nEXT. RIVER STREAM - NIGHT\n\nThey walk along the edges of the river, with deliberation. It is obvious that \nthey have walked this route many times. They reach a cut-off point and circle \nback into the woods, and pick up a pathway --\n\nEXT. PATHWAY - NIGHT \n\nThey pick up speed in close approach to a weeded area and stop. DAVID looks \nabout in disappointment. SOUNDER scratches the earth -- NATHAN looks out into \nthe darkness with a nagging expression on his face --\n\nTITLES INTERRUPTED\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID LEE\n\t\tThere ain't no possums in this woods tonight, \n\t\tDaddy.\n\n\t\t\t\tNATHAN LEE\n\t\tLooks that way, son.

It is a sound that \nbounces -- soulful, louder and clearer than any purebred redbone. It is \nspaced with precision, bouncing from slope to slope like a rubber ball, \nfilling up the night with music as though the branches of all the trees were \nbeing pulled across silver strings.\n\nEXT. THE BASE OF THE TREE WHERE THE POSSUM HAS TAKEN REFUGE - NIGHT \n\nSOUNDER arrives and makes a leap to climb the tree as NATHAN and DAVID rush \non to the scene. NATHAN looks up and points to the spot where the possum is. \nHe puts his rifle down near him, and DAVID assists him in the shaking of the \ntree as SOUNDER makes his leaps upward to the rhythm of the sound coming from \nhis voice. The possum gives way to the force and falls to the ground. SOUNDER \ncharges for the animal -- NATHAN quickly picks up his rifle and aims for the \nanimal. He fires into blank darkness and misses. The possum recovers from the \nfall and scampers into thick brushland, with SOUNDER in close pursuit.\n\nEXT. THE AREA OF THE THICK BRUSHLAND - NIGHT \n\nSOUNDER cannot overcome the briar thickness of the brushland -- but the \npossum with his smaller size manages to elude the dog.\n\nEXT. THE EDGES OF THE BRUSHLAND AREA - NIGHT \n\nSOUNDER comes out of the brush area, whining in frustration as NATHAN and \nDAVID approach him.
