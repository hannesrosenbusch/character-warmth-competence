Camera PANS to show two cute high school \n  girls, MASAMI and TOMOKO.  Masami is seated on the floor at a low coffee \n  table, TEXTBOOK in front of her. Tomoko is at her desk.  There are SNACKS \n  all over the room, and its obvious there hasnt been much studying going \n  on. Masami is currently in mid-story, speaking excitedly.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASAMI\n\t\tThey say that some elementary school \n\t\tkid spent the night with his parents \n\t\tat a bed and breakfast in Izu.  The kid\n\t\twanted to go out and play with everybody, \n\t\tright, but he didnt want to miss the \n\t\tprogram he always used to watch back in \n\t\tTokyo, so he records it on the VCR in \n\t\ttheir room.  But of course the stations \n\t\tin Izu are different from the ones in \n\t\tTokyo.  In Izu, it was just an empty \n\t\tchannel, so he shouldve recorded\n\t\tnothing but static.  But when the kid \n\t\tgets back to his house and watches the \n\t\ttape, all of a sudden this woman comes \n\t\ton the screen and says--\n\n  Masami points so suddenly and dramatically at her friend that Tomoko \n  actually jumps in her seat.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASAMI (contd)\n\t\tOne week from now, you will die.",

The scene is of \n  a WOMAN brushing her long hair before an oval-shaped MIRROR.  The nerve-\n  wracking grating as if of some giant metallic insect sounds in the \n  background, but the lady doesnt seem to notice.  The mirror the lady is \n  using to brush her hair suddenly changes position from the left part of \n  the wall before which she stands, to the right.  Almost instantly the \n  mirror returns to its original position, but in that one moment in its \n  changed location we see a small FIGURE in a white GOWN.  The woman turns \n  towards where that figure stood, and smiles.\n\n  The screen next becomes a twitching, undulating impenetrable sea of the \n  kanji characters used in the Japanese language.  Asakawa can pick out \n  only two things recognizable:\n\n    local     volcanic eruption\n\n  Now the screen is awash in PEOPLE-- crawling, scrabbling, shambling \n  masses, some of them moving in reverse.  A sound like moaning accompanies \n  them.\n  -\n\n  A FIGURE stands upon a shore, its face shrouded.  It points accusingly, \n  not towards the screen, but at something unseen off to one side.  The \n  insect-like screeching sounds louder. \n  --\n\n  Close up on inhuman, alien-looking EYE.

A thick clump of long, black \n  hair.\n\n  Suddenly a pale, thin ARM shoots out from beneath the water, catching \n  Asakawa just below the wrist.  Asakawas ears are filled with a SOUND \n  like moaning as something slowly rises from its watery slumber.  It \n  is a GIRL, her face completely hidden by long, black hair.
