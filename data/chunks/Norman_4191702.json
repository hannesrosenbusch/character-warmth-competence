My idea is\nto find someone here, someone like\nJo Wilf, or an Arthur Taub, who\nwould buy that debt. Pay the\nPalestinians eighty or ninety cents\non_the dollar, assuming that the\nPalestinians will take what they\ncan get at this point, and that the\nIsraeli government would have no\nchoice but to honor their debt to\nan American financial institution.\n\nWe see PHILIP COHEN (40) listening to Norman in a crowded\nStarbucks with a polite but very skeptical look on his face.\n\nNORMAN (CONT'D)\n(passing the napkin to\nPhilip)\nEverybody wins.
