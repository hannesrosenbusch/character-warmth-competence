A HOUSE ON A HILL - NIGHT\nMUSIC: :\n\nWe are looking up at a house. It stands some distance\naway, on a hill. From the moment WE SEE it we know that\nit is a house of terror -- imposing, Gothic, gloomy,\nmenacing. Perhaps it is reminiscent of the house in\nPsycho, perhaps -- though not a castle -- it has the\ndeserted soulless empty quality of Kane's house when\nseen first through its gates.\n\nThe MUSIC WE HEAR is Thriller music, urgent strings,\n\n‘suggesting panic, suggesting unspoken evil. Bernard\n\nHermann sort-of-music.\n\nAnd the weather is overcast. There is a watery moon\nstruggling to break through racing clouds. -But a\nthunderstorm is on the way.\n\nSuperimpose: MAIN TITLES\n\nA car turns off a ‘highway onto a country lane leading\ntowards the house. The car would not be the-cat's whiskers\neven in the year in which this story takes place.\n\nEND TITLES - SUPERIMPOSE \"1954\"\n\nCAMERA ‘CRANES DOWN .and MOVES WITH the car AS it approaches\nthe gates of the house. They are closed. A man gets out\nof the car. He is a BUTLER. He is dressed like a butler.\nHe has the manner of a butler. Even when opening gates\nall alone he does so with the demeanour of a butler. ‘His\nname is WADSWORTH. Having opened the gates, he sits back\nin his car, and motors slowly up the private drive.\n\nEXT. THE FRONT. DOOR - NIGHT\n\nAs THE BUTLER's car draws to a halt, there is a distant\nRUMBLE of THUNDER. Lights can be seen through some of\n\nthe ground floor windows.

He stops at the\nopen Dining Room door and looks in. The table is\nbeautifully and meticulously laid for dinner for seven.\n\n*\n\nINT. THE LIBRARY - NIGHT\n\nYVETTE is the French Maid. She is young, beautiful, with\na great figure which is tightly encased in a maid's uni-\nform -- black dress, little white apron and cap, sheer\nblack stockings and dainty black shoes. But the skirt is\nshorter than normal, and very tight over her bottom --\nand her black dress is very low cut. Her ample bosom is\npushed right up and half out of the top of the dress.\nShe is an outrageous young lady, with an improbable French\naccent which cannot be reproduced on the page. She has\nbeen polishing a glass, and dancing to the latest poo\nmusic on the radio. She bends forward to replace the\nglass on the tray, her breasts falling beautifully forward.\nWADSWORTH watches.\nWADSWORTH |\nIs everything ready?\nYVETTE\nOui, Monsieur.\nWADSWORTH\nYou have your instructions.\n\nWADSWORTH leaves the library, YVETTE sniffs and makes a\nface.",
