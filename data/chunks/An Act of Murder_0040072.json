There are only a few passersby.  One\n\n                of them is MacIlwain.  He walks slowly on the south\n\n                side of the street looking at the second story windows\n\n                on the other side.  Suddenly, he stops.\n\n\n\n                NEW ANGLE - SHOOTING PAST MacIlwain to an open window\n\n                on the second floor in the house opposite.  The lace\n\n                curtains move in the gentle morning breeze and beyond\n\n                them can be seen the flashing oval mirror held between\n\n                two horns of wood above an ornate dresser.  The room is\n\n                a bedroom and so far as can be seen, it is empty.\n\n\n\n                CLOSE FULL SHOT of MacIlwain as he takes a few more\n\n                steps down the street and pauses to look again.\n\n\n\n                ANOTHER ANGLE - This is the same setup as the previous\n\n                one, SHOOTING PAST MacIlwain to SHOW the next window; a\n\n                double one.  Through this window can be seen a stained\n\n                oak sideboard and other evidences that this is a dining\n\n                room.  At the table there can be clearly see through\n\n                the window and on old white-haired woman.  She uses her\n\n                napkin daintily against her lips and looks up.  Out of\n\n                the gloom back of her comes a tall, thin blond young\n\n                man dressed in a neat business suit and carrying a tan\n\n                hat in his hand.  He leans forward and kisses the old\n\n                woman.  After he straightens from the kiss, she pats\n\n                his arm affectionately and they speak together for a\n\n                few seconds but their words cannot be heard because of\n\n                the great distance.  Then he bends to peck at her cheek\n\n                again, turns and disappears into the darkness at the\n\n                other end of the room.\n\n\n\n                FULL SHOT - MacIlwain.  He takes his glance from the\n\n                window, rummages through his pocket for a cigarette,\n\n                then for matches, all the while watching the door of\n\n                the house opposite.",

He lights his cigarette, blows out the\n\n                match and throws it away, still standing watching him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                EXT.

A white-capped chef is\n\n                busily baking hot cakes, tossing them with histrionic\n\n                skill.  So used are the passersby to this sight of\n\n                culinary legerdemain that no one pauses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                INT. CHILD'S RESTAURANT - MORNING\n\n\n\n                MED.

The CAMERA DOLLIES\n\n                with her as, tray in hand, she walks hastily toward the\n\n                kitchen.

One of the waitresses,\n\n                Blanche, is a woman about fifty, heavily rouged and\n\n                madeup.  The makeup on this harsh, lined face assumes a\n\n                grotesque effect.  Her arms and hands show the muscles\n\n                of a veteran waitress.  The other girl, Sylvia, young,\n\n                frivolous is about Sally's age, but much wiser in the\n\n                ways of the world she knows.  The manager, white\n\n                coated, his trousers sharply creased, his hair pomaded\n\n                to the shine of a skating rink, is the first to speak.\n\n\n\n                                      MANAGER\n\n                          Sally, you can't keep us in suspense --\n\n                          then what?\n\n\n\n                                      SALLY\n\n                          But a customer was looking for me.",

MaoIlwain lies on the bed\n\n               sleeping soundly with only a sheet pulled over his pajama\n\n               clad body. A black eye bandage is over his eyes and rubber\n\n               stopples in his ears. From outside comes the yammering and\n\n               shouting of innumerable children at play in the street with\n\n               an obligato of taxi horns and the roar of traffic on a nearby\n\n               avenue.\n\n\n\n               There is a knock at the door. MacIlwain does not stir. The\n\n               knock is repeated louder. Still there is no response. Then an\n\n               even more thunderous hammering of knuckles on the door panel.\n\n               This finally rouses the sleeper. He shucks the eye shade,\n\n               removes the stopples, glances at the alarm clock beside his\n\n               bed, curses under his breath and finally lowers his feet to\n\n               the floor and staggers across the room and opens the door.                                     \n\n\n\n                                      MITCHELL'S VOICE\n\n                                (Through the door)\n\n                          Mr. MacIlwain?\n\n\n\n                                      MACILWAIN\n\n                          Yeah?\n\n\n\n                Mitchell comes through the door.
