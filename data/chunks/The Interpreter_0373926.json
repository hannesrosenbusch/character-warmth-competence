Think Cary Grant - the aging, Technicolor Cary Grant -\nwearing a great three-button suit and smoking in an Eames chair as\nHitchcock wanders past behind him.\n\fEXT. AFRICAN VILLAGE (REPUBLIC OF MATOBO) - DAY\n\nIn a heavy dust storm, two dirt roads meet at an abandoned\njunction. Four old tires lay half-buried in the middle, the\nvague suggestion of a roundabout. Telephone wires dance\n\nangrily above. Corrugated tin roofs rattle in the distance.\n\nReaching over the far road - not thirty feet away but barely\nvisible in the storm - is an old wooden arch. Its long-faded\nslogan reads, “PRAISE AND WELCOME EDMOND ZUWANIE”.\n\nA Land Rover emerges from the dirt fog behind it.\n\nINT. LAND ROVER\n\nA BOOKISH AFRICAN MAN (48) drives.
