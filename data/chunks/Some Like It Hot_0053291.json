All four seem fully aware of the solemnity of the \noccasion.\n\nNow they hear a SIREN, faint at first, but rapidly growing \nlouder.  The driver and the man next to him exchange a \nnervous glance.  The other two men move tensely toward \nthe rear door of the hearse, raise the black curtain over the \nglass panel, and peek out cautiously.\n\nThrough the glass panel, they see a police car bearing down \non them, the red light blinking, the SIREN screaming.\n\nThe two men at the rear window gesture to the driver to \nstep on it.  He does.\n\nThe hearse, obviously a souped-up job, instantly picks up \nspeed, weaves crazily through traffic, the police car in hot \npursuit.  The hearse careens around a corner at eighty \nmiles an hour, the police car right on its tail.\n\nBy this time the policemen are leaning out of their car with \ndrawn guns, firing at the hearse.\n\nThe two men in the rear of the hearse, flattened against the \nsides, pull a couple of sawed-off shotguns out of a hidden \noverhead rack.  Police bullets smash the glass panel and \nwhistle through the hearse.  The driver and the man next to \nhim duck, but the hearse continues at the same breakneck \nspeed.  The two men in back shove their guns through the \nshattered glass, fire at the police car.",

The two men in back shove their guns through the \nshattered glass, fire at the police car. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\nDespite the hail of lead, the police car - its windshield \ncobwebbed with bullet holes - gains on the hearse.\n\nSuddenly the car skids out of control, jumps the curb, \ncomes to a screeching stop.  Policemen leap out, fire after \nthe hearse.\n\nIn the speeding hearse, the last of the police bullets thud \ninto the coffin.  Instantly three geysers of liquid spurt \nthrough the bullet holes.  As the firing recedes, the two men \nin the back put away their guns, remove the wreath from \nthe coffin, take the lid off.  The inside is jam-packed with \nbottles of booze, some of them shattered by the bullets.

All the shops are dark except one - a dimly \nlit establishment, from which drift the mournful strains of \nan organ.  A circumspect sign reads:\n\nMOZARELLA'S FUNERAL PARLOR\n24 Hour Service\n\nIn the window, a sample coffin is on display.\n\nThere seem to be some rites going on inside, because a \nnumber of mourners, singly and in couples, are hurrying \nfrom the cold, windy street into Mozarella's parlor.\n\nMeanwhile, the hearse with the damp coffin draws up to the \ndelivery entrance at the side of the building.  The driver \nhonks the horn - one long and two short - as the other men \nstep down and start to slide the coffin out.  The side door \nopens, and a dapper gent emerges.  He wears a tight-fitting \nblack suit, a black fedora, and gray spats.  The spats are \nvery important.  He always wears spats.  His name is SPATS \nCOLOMBO.
