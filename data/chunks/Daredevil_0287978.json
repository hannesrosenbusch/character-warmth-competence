Rotten haystacks of moldered meat, soiled\ndiapers, and sour milk crowd the sidewalks and stoops.\n\nA HISS OF STEAM bursts from a sewer grate. It RISES UP like\na spirit, skirting the face of a crumbling Catholic church as\nthe sound of wind WHISTLES through CREAKING rafters. An oily\nrat SKITTERS along a rain gutter matted with dry leaves. Each\nnoise is exaggerated, amplified into a symphony of sounds.\nDRIP. DRIP. DRIP.\n\nDROPS OF BLOOD trickle down a stained glass window; cutting a\nclear trail across the dusty pane. We trace the blood trail\nup to a large CRUCIFIX at the roof’s peak.\n\nDRIP. DRIP. DRIP. DRIP.\n\nThe droplets become rivulets as we reveal a SILHOUETTE draped\nover the cross. The silhouette of a devil. A SEARCHLIGHT\n\nfrom a POLICE HELICOPTER cuts a path across the rooftops,\nrevealing the devil to be a man in costume.\n\nThis is DAREDEVIL.\n\nSo forget what you know about superheroes. Because this is\nthe real world. And in the real world there is no such thing\nas “mutant healing’ or “spider sense” to keep a man alive.\n\nIn the real world there's just a guy in a mask.\n\nAnd he’s bleeding to death.\n\nINT.
