COUNTRYSIDE - SUNSET                                         1\n\n    A serene landscape, mist collecting as the red ball of a sun\n\n    dips behind the mountains.\n\n\n\n    In the middle of a field stands a bare-chested man facing the\n\n    sunset. He is HARRIS, forty-ish, greying but handsome, and\n\n    very fit. His hands are outstretched as if embracing an\n\n    invisible entity. He seems filled with some sort of\n\n    transcendental power. Now, an air of fulfillment and resolve\n\n    settles over him. He turns and walks away from us. CAMERA\n\n    ADJUSTS and reveals--\n\n\n\n\n\n2   EXT. UNITY HOUSE - LONG SHOT - SUNSET                             2\n\n    Once the home of Victorian Gentry, a few seasons of amateur\n\n    repair work have not compensated for decades of neglect. But\n\n    now as Harris walks towards it, the fading daylight and long\n\n    shadows turn it into a fantasy castle. MUSIC ECHOES faintly\n\n    from within; it's \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\" by Iron Butterfly. If\n\n    the music didn't place the era for us, the battered VW\n\n    MINIBUS parked outside the house does; it's covered with\n\n    flower paintings, slogans, and the ubiquitous peace sign.\n\n\n\n    As Harris approaches the house, a dozen or so YOUNG PEOPLE\n\n    rush to greet him and embrace him. Extending his arms out to\n\n    enclose them all, he goes inside.\n\n\n\n\n\n3   INT. COMMON ROOM - SUNSET                                         3\n\n    This was probably a stately parlor in its day. There is a\n\n    funky assembly of odd handmade furniture. There are muslin\n\n    curtains on the windows, crude paintings, and quilts covering\n\n    ripped chairs and couches. Despite the squalor, there is a\n\n    neatness to the place. Now, the CAMERA begins to ROAM\n\n    through the room and down the hallways lined with fading\n\n    wallpaper.\n\n\n\n                        VOICES\n\n                  (various)\n\n              --where did she go...? ... was\n\n              here a moment ago...
