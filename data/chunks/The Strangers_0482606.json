It has rained recently and the ground is wet\naround the scattered mail boxes that line the old gravel\nroad.\n\nThe street is deserted. Empty.\n\nDETECTIVE (V.0.)\nOkay. Let’s try and do this all at\nonce.(Coughs) Can you hear me\nalright? I’m just gonna start.\nAlright?\n\nEXT. HOUSE - DAY\n\nA large single story house sits a thousand yards from its\nclosest neighbor. There is a long cement driveway that leads\ndown the side of the property.\n\nAt the end, towards the house, sits a once blue four-door\nsedan. Smoke rises above the charred remains. The windows\nare smashed out and the tires are slashed. Broken pieces of\nglass surround the car as it sits flat against its metal\nrims.\n\nThe car is running.\n\nOver the blackened hood stands a faded basketball goal. A\nnet hangs on for its life from the rusty orange hoop.\n\nDETECTIVE (V.0O.)\n1801 Clark Road. Stop. (Coughs)\n1801 Clark Road as follows: 4\nkitchen knives, varying sizes. 2\ncandle sticks.

They wear pressed white shirts and\nblack slacks.\n\nThey are Mormons.\n\nThe taller boy, has a backpack slung over one shoulder. The\n\nother one holds a pile of pamphlets. They both have flat\ntops.\n\f2.\n\nThe boys make their way down the street and they huddle close\ntogether to attempt to shield themselves from the wind\nwhipping across their skin.\n\nThey are two houses down from the basketball goal. So far,\nno one is home on the street. They take turns walking to\neach house, knocking and ringing the doorbells. When there\nis no answer, they leave the pamphlets on the mat or in the\nmailbox and walk back up to the road again.\n\nThe boys do not play around with each other as they walk the\nroad between houses.",

She wipes tears from her face.\n\nThey are still dressed from this evening’s wedding, but both\nlook as if they have seen a battlefield. The stains of red\nwine cover Kristen’s skin.

Her face reacts to what she sees\nbeing illuminated in front of her. Each pool of light\nreveals more of the surprise James had planned for her that\nnight.\n\nThere are two place settings surrounded by candles on the\ndining room table. A bottle of champagne chills in an ice\nbucket. Many bright flower petals are scattered across the\ncouch.\n\nWith each flick of a switch, James attempts to remain\nemotionless, but his hands tremble as he works.\n\nKristen reaches for support, accidentally leaning back\nagainst the piano keys. An abrupt burst of sound from the\npiano causes her to jump. Without trying to restrain\nherself, tears flow down her wine stained face.\n\fINT. PARLOR - NIGHT\n\nJames turns on the light in the parlor and the record player\nstarts up. There is a second of static and then the chords\nof an old country song slowly come up to speed. This hurts\nKristen even more.\n\nJames is caught off guard by these breaks from the silence\nand he moves to shut down the record player, but he pauses\nfor a second and they both listen to the familiar song.\n\nKRISTEN\nWhen did you do all this?\n\nJAMES\nToday.

BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nWhen James opens the door, more of his preparation for their\nromantic evening is revealed. More rose petals cover the\nbed, and what seems like a million or more candles wait to be\nlit around them.\n\nHe flips on the bathroom light and grabs another champagne\nbottle from near the bed. As he crosses back towards the\n\ndoor, he slowly brushes past Kristen. For a second, they\n\nstand close to each other, then he moves to the door.\n\nJAMES\nYou can have this room.

DINING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nJames walks over to the dining room and flips off the\noverhead light. In the darkness he grabs a book of matches,\nlighting the candles he had set out before.
