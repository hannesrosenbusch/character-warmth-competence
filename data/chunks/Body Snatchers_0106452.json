EXT. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n EDINBURGH STREET -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\nFULL SPOT -- Down the lonely, almost deserted street comes a\ncab drawn by a bony white horse. This black and sepulchral\nvehicle passes through the long shadows and sharp gleams of\nthe late afternoon sun. On the box, bunched over, almost\nlost in the folds of his triple-caped overcoat and with a\nbattered beaver on his hand, is the cabman. The horse plods\nalong, his hoof beats echoing with a hollow sound in the\nnarrow street. At the corner the vehicle turns left.\n\nEXT. GREYFRIAR'S CHURCHYARD -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\n \n\nThe black cab drawn by the white horse goes slowly past a\nlittle cemetery. The driver turns his head and looks down as\nhe goes past.\n\nFrom his ANGLE, but not a MOVING SHOT, a pleasant little\ngraveyard with mossy gravestones; old turf making a spot of\ngreen between the gray walls of the kirk and the blank stone\nwall of a large building.\n\nSeated on a table stone is young Donald Fettes, a poor\nmedical student, dressed in worn neat clothing with only a\nwoolen scarf about his neck for warmth. He sits in such\nscanty sunlight as he can find, munching on a cold bannock\nand washing it down with thin ale from a round stone bottle.\n\nMED. CLOSE SHOT -- Fettes. In the closer view it can be seen\nthat he is looking at a small Cairn terrier who lies morosely\nguarding a newly-made grave. The dog, with his head down\nbetween his forepaws, occasionally glances over\napprehensively at the young student. Fettes takes a bit of\nhis bannock between his thumb and forefinger and leans\nforward toward the dog.\n\nFETTES\n\fHere, -- here's a bit of something\nfor you.\n\nThe dog does not stir. Fettes leans further forward almost\nputting the morsel of food to the dog's nose. The dog growls\nsavagely. Fettes draws back.\n\nFETTES (cont'd)\nNow, now, laddie -- I only wanted\nto be friendly.",

He looks up.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE -- Fettes looking over as Mrs. MacBride, a\nplump, motherly woman of middle-age, with a Tartan shawl over\nher head and carrying a pannikin of water and a bone with\nsome meat on it, comes through the gate. She crosses over to\nthe little dog, puts the water before him and starts\nshredding little pieces of meat from the bone to feed him.\nThe dog laps avidly at the water, then gratefully takes the\nmorsels of meat she gives him.\n\nMED.

EDINBURGH STREET -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\nLONG SHOT -- a typical street scene of the time. A dog cart\ndrawn by a smart tandem passes. It is driven by a young buck\nof the period; top-hatted, dandified, his whip held at a just\nso angle. On the sidewalk, a group of small boys follow a\nrecruiting sergeant of the Seaforth Highlanders. A drummer\n\nwalks at his heels. He stops at a wooden \"Charlie\", the\nrough police booth of that day, and begins to tack up his\nposters. The boys crowd around to watch. One of them backs\n\nup to a little trundle cart and surreptitiously filches a\npiece of the shortbread being sold from this portable store.\nAt the other side of the \"Charlie\" stands a street singer, a\nbeautiful girl of about nineteen, dressed in ragged Highland\nplaid. She is singing an old border ballad about two crows\nwho sit waiting to pick the dead eyes out of a fallen knight.\nA shepherd, crook in hand, and faithfully attended by two\nhandsome collies, stops a moment to hear her song, drops some\ncoppers into the begging bowl she holds in her hands, then\npasses on.\n\nThrough the consonance of the street singer's song comes the\ndissonant beat of a horse's hoofs, the racking clatter of\niron-shod wheels and then between the singer and the CAMERA\nthere passes, very close, the white horse and the black cab.\nAs it blocks her out of the scene\n\nWIPE DISSOLVE\n\nEXT. MACFARLANE'S HOUSE -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\n \n\fFULL SHOT -- Before the imposing edifice which houses Dr.\nMacFarlane's living quarters as well as his school of\nanatomy, the cab, drawn by the white horse, pulls up. The\ndriver begins to alight from the box. He climbs down, and\nstarts for the cab door.\n\nCLOSE SHOT -- Gray as he opens the door.",

CLOSE SHOT -- Gray as he opens the door. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n Gray is a man of\nmiddle years with keen, darting eyes set in a face lined and\nfurrowed by an evil life. The quick play of his features as\nhe talks or smiles can form a moving and deceptive mask. So\nthat now as he opens the door, smiling, to help his\npassengers alight, his face is cringing with good humor and\nservility.\n\nFrom the cab steps a young and lovely woman dressed in\nbecoming widow's weeds. This is Mrs. Marsh. She reaches the\nsidewalk, turns back for the other occupant of the cab. This\nis a little girl of about eight, dressed in a flower-sprigged\nKate Greenway gown and a poke bonnet to match. Gray\nforestalls her.\n\nGRAY\nI'll get it, matam.\n\nHe touches his hat respectfully, reaches in and brings out a\ntiny wheel-chair, which he sets down. He reaches in again\nand takes the child up in his arms.\n\nGRAY (cont'd)\n(as he picks her up)\nCome, little miss. Cabman Gray'll\ncarry you safe enough.\n\nWith the child in his arms he starts toward his horse's head,\ntalking as he goes.\n\nGRAY (cont'd)\nGive my horse a pat. He knows\nevery little girl in Edinburgh.\nSome day when you're runnin' and\nplayin’ in the street he'll nicker\nat ye as we go by.\n\nCLOSE SHOT -- The horse, Gray, and the little girl.\n\nGEORGINA\nI can't run and play.\n\nGRAY\nI'd forgotten that, lassie. All\nthe more reason for Friend here\nbidding you a good-day.\n\nGeorgina smiles and pats the horse's nose.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE -- Featuring Mrs. Marsh as she smiles watching\nGray and the child. He turns back toward her.\n\fMRS. MARSH\nWould you mind carrying her up the\nsteps?\n\nMrs. Marsh reaches for the wheel-chair.\n\nFULL SHOT -- Mrs. Marsh takes the wheel-chair up the two\nsteps. Gray follows carrying the child. He sets the child\ntenderly in the wheel-chair, smiling as he does so.\n\nGRAY\nBack in your own wee cab.\n\nGEORGINA\nThank you.\n\nIn the meantime, Mrs. Marsh has fumbled through her purse for\nchange.",

Now in response the\ndoor is opened by a handsome woman of thirty-five, Meg\nCameron.\n\nMRS. MARSH\nI would like to see Dr. MacFarlane.\n\nMeg gives Mrs. Marsh a quick look and then turns to look at\nGray. A glance passes between them; a glance which tells of\nprevious acquaintance, yet neither speaks. He turns and goes\ndown the steps. Silently, Meg opens the door and allows Mrs.\nMarsh to push Georgina's wheel chair through into the hall.\n\nINT. MACFARLANE'S HALLWAY -- AFTERNOON\n\nGeorgina's wheel chair is pushed into this gloomy and\nforbidding entry. Meg closes the door behind them, then\nwithout further word, strides down the hall. Mrs. Marsh and\nthe little girl wait and look around.\n\nCLOSE SHOT -- Georgina. With great wide eyes the child looks\naround at the antlered stag head, the cruel-looking walking\nsticks in the umbrella stand and the light-footed Mercury\nwith caduceus upraised. The caduceus throws its patterned\n\fshadow across the child's face.\n\nCLOSE TWO SHOT -- Georgina and Mrs. Marsh. Mrs. Marsh sees\nthe fright in the child's face and reassuringly pats her\nshoulder.
