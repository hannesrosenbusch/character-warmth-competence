A voice from under the covers.\n\nBURT\nNothing.\n\nVERONA\nThat’s what I mean. Why’d you stop?\n\nBURT\nI'm trying to figure out the best\nway to say what I’m about to say.\n\nVERONA\nIt’s been a while since I waxed...\n\nBURT\nNo, no.\n(still trying to find the\nbest way to say it)\nUh. You taste different.\n\nVerona sits up, sighing.\n\nVERONA\nPlease. Last time you complained\nabout the taste I banned you from\nmy region for a year. You want me\nto shower?\n\nBurt emerges from under the covers and stares at Verona.\nBURT\nNo, you’re clean. But you know a\nwoman can taste different depending\non various co-factors.\n\nVerona sits up in a huff.\n\n*\n\fVERONA\nI don’t want to hear this.

He reads widely but not deeply\nenough, and has many strange hobbies, which he indulges for\nshort periods of time but with utter seriousness. The last\nsuch hobby was bear-tracking. He works in the insurance\nindustry.\n\nVERONA DE TESSANT is of mixed race - her mom was white, her\nfather black. She’s very cute, diminutive, a bit feisty.\nShe’s a medical illustrator and has the necessary combination\nof the artistic and the exacting. Of the pair, she is the\nmore socially presentable and stable, and finds herself\napologizing for her partner at least once a week. Still, she\nis devoted to him and he to her.

The saddest thing is that this is a brand-new pre-\nnatal fitness DVD.\n\nVERONA\nI wish you could see this, Grace.\n\nWe see Grace, Verona’s sister, on the other end of the phone.\nGRACE is striking-looking: caramel-skinned, thin, curvy.\n\nShe's immaculately dressed, projecting an air of\nsophistication and professionalism. She paces around her\n\noffice at work -- a glass building in Phoenix, dramatic\ndesert view -- with a hands-free device attached to her ear.\nVERONA\nYou want to hear the rhyming\ncouplets?\n\nInstead of reaching for a bagel\nDo another Kegel\n\nGRACE\nNo!\n\nVERONA\nYou like that?

I want it to... But I\n\nalso want it to be new, you know?\nNew for us? New enough to feel like\nwe found it? Does that make sense?\n\nBURT\nIt does.\n\nVERONA\n(seeing something)\nOh god, I remember that!\n\nThey both look at a tree in front of someone’s yard,\ndecorated with a dozen kinds of fruit -- apples, oranges,\nbananas, pineapples. The owner has strung fake fruit from the\nbranches.\n\nVERONA\n\nI have to call Grace.\n\n(she dials)\nYup, we’‘re almost there.\n\n(pause)\nNo, I’m fine.\n\n(pause)\nIt is! That’s why I called. We just\npassed it. Pineapples! Yes. No, I\ndidn’t see the cantaloupe...\n\n(to Burt)\nWait, that was it.\n\n+ FH HHH HH FH *\n\n %\n\n+ eH\n\n+ HH HH HH HF\n\f121.\n\nThey've just missed a turn.\n\nVERONA\n(to Grace)\nI’1ll call you after we get there.\nLove you.\n\nShe hangs up. Sighs. Burt backs up.",

Are you?\n\nBURT\nI am.\n\nThey head down a narrow winding road canopied by wisteria and\nkudzu. Burt is clearly in heaven; it’s the landscape of his\ndreams.\n\nEXT. BEAUTIFUL SEMI-RURAL CULDESAC\n\nThey pull up to a Victorian house, three-storied and grand,\nthough in disrepair.\n\nVERONA\nOh! I forgot how beautiful it is.\n\nWe realize this is Verona’s childhood home, the same house we\nsaw in the photo in Grace and Verona’s offices. It’s\ndilapidated but full of character and potential.\n\nThey park and get out of the car.\n\nThere’s a creek running through the property; a bridge over\nit connects the driveway to the front door. Burt is\nastounded, taking it all in.\n\nBURT\nI love your parents so much right\nnow. They were geniuses. This is\nwhat I want for our baby.\n\nTears burst from Verona.\n\nAs they walk toward the front door, Verona leans on Burt for\nstrength. She hasn’t been back home in 10 years.\n\n+e HF\n\n*\n\n*\n\f122.\n\nAt the doorway, Burt opens it and Verona has to steady\nherself on the frame. She slowly slides down until she’s\nsitting, overwhelmed.\n\nBurt sits with Verona, looking around the house, inside and\nout.\n\nBURT\nThis is really us, don’t you think?\n\nVERONA\nI think it is. I fucking hope so.\n\nWe pull back until we’re outside the door. The door closes.\n\nTHE END.\n\f"
