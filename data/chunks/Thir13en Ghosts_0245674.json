They move beneath the\ntitles, brilliant against the darkness, the ghost-like\napparitions fighting a current as if caught in the\nwhirlwind of time.\n\nOur IMAGE SHARPENS.

The tape dances before us, undulating to\na macabre rhythm, floating on the nocturnal winds. We\nPAN.\n\nAn auto wrecking yard at midnight. Empty, yet occupied.\n\nLight slowly INVADES the FRAME, filling in the wrecking\nyard's cavernous shadows. A distant ROAR announces\nitself above the SOUNDTRACK, the earth POUNDING CLAMOR\nAMPLIFYING in with every second.\n\nAs if searching for its source, CAMERA PIVOTS AROUND.\nInstantly, we find ourselves caught in the glare of\nheadlights, and we've just enough time to make out the\nsemi truck before it plows through the yard's chain link\ngate, shattering it like so much glass, the truck heading\ndirectly AT CAMERA, running it over as if it weren't\nthere.\n\nEXT.
