Like a fable,\nthere is sorrow, and like a fable, it is full of wonder and\nhappiness.\n\nTITLE CARD\nArezzo, Italy\n1919\n\nSCENE 1\n\nUnder a beautiful, crystalline sky, a Balilla convertible piled high with luggage makes its smooth,\nhappy way through the placid Tuscan hills. FERRUCCIO, a plump young man with a jovial—\nalmost boyish—look about him is driving. His friend, GUIDO, is in the passenger seat. He hugs\nthe wheel as he recites lines of verse in a clear, bucolic tone.\n\nFERRUCCIO\nI sing what I see\nNothing gets by me.\n\nHe raises his voice as the car picks up speed, flying downhill.\n\nFERRUCCIO\n“Here I am,” said I to chaos, “I am your slave!” “Good!” “For\nwhat,” said I, “free in the end am I! What good is a caress when\nbliss...this man came to possess?”\n\n«_. Here | am, ready, the trains are gone, the brakes are gone and\nTcan resist no more....Go sweet Bacchus, take me...the brakes\nare gone, oh...”\n\n{in a higher, worried voice)\nThe brakes are gone!\n\nHis friend says, from under his hat,\n\nGUIDO\nTheard you!\n\nFERRUCCIO\nNo, the brakes! They’re really gone! Hit the brakes!\n\nAnd he furiously kicks the dead brake pedal. At the first curve the car nearly goes off the road.\nGuido bounces like a spring and grabs the rolls of upholstery fabric, the car seats, the suitcases.\n\nGUIDO\nWeren't you reciting a poem?\n\fFERRUCCIO\nIt doesn’t work.\n\nGUIDO\nBrake! We're going to die! The woods! Brake!\n\nGuido pulls the hand brake, but it’s broken and nothing happens. Meanwhile, the car is gathering\nspeed. It takes a sharp curve, goes off.the road,.and bounces down into a field, cutting the bushes\nin its path. Guido falls backward onto the uphoistery rolls.",

The windshield is\ncovered in twigs and leaves. Poor Ferruccio is now driving blind. Guido stands up, holding on\nwherever he can, grabbing the windshield and looking ahead, trying to guide his friend.\n\nSCENE 2\nA PAVED ROAD RUNNING THROUGH A VILLAGE—EXT., DAY\n\nMAN #1\nThe king is coming.\n\nWOMAN #1\nThere he is!\n\nGUIDO\nIt’s full of people down there.\n\nIn fact, beyond the long curve the road straightens and runs through a village where a local festival is\nin progress, complete with a band and Royalist and Fascist Youth banners and placards. When the\ncrowd of locals, waiting in the shadow of a dais and holding placards that say LONG LIVE THE KING,\nsee Guido and Ferruccio’s extravagantly “decorated car” and the motorcycle escort approach, they\nbegin to applaud. The band strikes up the Royal March, and adults and children salute the “king”\nas he passes. Guido, his arm held high and stiff, shouts into the festive pandemonium.\n\nGUIDO\nWe have no brakes! Move!\n\nHis gesture is mistaken for the Fascist salute. The villagers raise their arms and shout loud and\nstrong,‘Long live the king!” The car, festooned with flowers and with its train of white and gold\nfabric, zooms through town and disappears into a curve at the bottom of the road. The crowd of\nvillagers breaks onto the asphalt, saluting the car as it disappears and forcing the royal car, a\nconvertible which has appeared (and in which are seated, in plain sight, His Majesty and the\nqueen), to stop short. The king’s chauffeur, honking the limousine’s hom, drives the car slowly\nthrough the incredulous crowd.\n\fSCENE 3\nA COUNTRY ROAD; A FARM—EXT.",

Three cows, two white\nand one black, are tied to a fence. The black cow is next to a water pump. Guido walks up to the\npump, hangs his coat and hat on a branch, and begins to pump water. Whistling, he fills a pail\nand washes his hands in the pail water, which immediately turns black. Nearby, a little girl is\nmilking a white cow. Drying his hands in the air, Guido walks up to her. A horse is hitched to a\nwagon filled with baskets of vegetables and flowers. Guido, curious, takes a good look. He is\nhappy, playful.\n\nGUIDO\nHello, little girl. Where’s your mother? Is she the one who\nloaded this wagon?\n\nELEONORA\nNo, the landlady did.\n\n \n\fGUIDO\nIs it a market? Where's your mother?

She loses her balance\nand falls out the window into Guido’s arms as pigeons flap their way noisily out of the loft\nwindow. Guido and Dora fall down, rolling on straw. She is on top of him, a veil over her face.\n\nGUIDO (laughing)\nGood morning, Princess!\n\nDORA\nHow frightening. I almost killed myself. Did I hurt you?\n\n \n\fGUIDO\nI've never been better.

Where it is night.\n\nSCENE 66\nTHE CAMP; DORA'S BARRACKS—INT., NIGHT\n\nThe poignant notes of the Barcarole travel on the dense, low fog that enfolds the camp yard. This\nmusic is Guido and Dora’s song. Now, the notes move through the moonlit haze and through the\ndark streets of the immense camp, looking for Dora. In the moonlight, the iron bars over the\nsmall windows shine brightly against the stones. Dora has gotten out of bed, drawn by the far-off\nmusic. She approaches the window, opens it, and looks out. She sees the moon, outlined clearly\nagainst the night, brightening the fog just over the officers’ mess, where the windows are lit up\non the top floor. The music is coming from there. She understands that it is for her—a serenade\nfor her.\n\nSCENE 67\nTHE CAMP—EXT., NIGHT\n\nIt is as if the music is muted by the fog.
