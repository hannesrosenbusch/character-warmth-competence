Smiling. Not aware that\nthis is not to be the comfortable acceptance speech you\nmight hear of a retiring employee getting his gold watch.\nThis will become what will later be called \"The Box of\nLights and Wires Speech”. One of THE MOST IMPORTANT\nbroadcast journalism speeches EVER. It is an attack on\neveryone in this room... an attack on himself. And, at\nthis point, it has just begun.\n\nMURROW (CONT'D)\n\nBut the elaborate structure of\nNetworks, Advertising Agencies and\nSponsers will not be shaken or\naltered. It is my desire, if not\nmy duty, to try to talk to you\njourneymen with some candor about\nwhat is happening to radio and\ntelevision. If what I have to say\nis responsible, then I alone am\nresponsible for the saying of it.\n\fMURROW\nOur history will be what we make\nof it.
