BEDROOM - MORNING\n\nWe pan through a bedroom who’s walls are covered with\nposters. Muppet posters. Muppet newspaper clippings. A framed\nphoto of a Time magazine cover which features Kermit standing\nin front of the rest of the Muppets with a headline that\nreads “Who's the funniest Muppet.”\n\nThere is also a row of framed photos, the first is of a young\nboy with a nondescript brown Puppet. We follow the row of\nphotos as the boy grows progressively older, his puppet\nalways by his side, ageless. We reach the last photo of the\nrow and the boy is now thirty, arm around his puppet.\n\nWe continue to pan and find the man, Gary, laying in bed\npeacefully asleep, a contented smile on his face. THE ALARM\nGOES OFF. Gary lazily wakes up.\n\nGARY\nWalter! Wake up! Today’s the day we\ngo to Los Angeles!!!\n\nWe widen to reveal Gary’s brown puppet asleep in a smaller\nbed next to Gary ala Ernie and Bert.\n\nWALTER\n(waking excitedly)\n\nLos Angeles!!!

GARY AND WALTER'S HOUSE - LATER\n\nGary and Walter exit their small but charming house wearing\nmatching Powder Blue suits and brown ties which are way too\nshort with knots that are far too large.

We watch as the bus pulls\naway, travelling only a few yards before it passes a sign\nwhich reads:\n\n“NOW LEAVING SMALLTOWN, USA.
