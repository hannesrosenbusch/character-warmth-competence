We see the earth through the\npilot's perspective as sky and ground swap positions, the\nplane swooping down and storming over the ground.\n\nTHE PLANE\n\nis a biplane, racing over a field lush with young plants. It\nreleases a trail of crop spray, and climbs again...\n\nUp into a crystalline blue sky where sunshine pours like\nhoney over family farms stretching to the horizon. Maybe\nit's not heaven, maybe it's just Tennessee. But as long as\nthere's been an America, men have fought and died for this\nplace -- as volunteers.\n\fFar off, but visible from the plane is\nA BARN - DAY\n\nThe barn is unpainted except for hand lettering that says\n\"McCawley Crop Dusting.\" Another plane noise, this one made\nby kids, brings us to TWO BOYS, sitting in the shell of an\nold plane propped on crates, scavenged of it's engine, seats,\nand wheels.\n\nThe boys sit in it's cockpit, butts crowded onto the nail keg\nthey've replaced the seat with. They've even attached a 2x4\nas propeller, as if their imaginations needed any help. They\nwear overalls and have bowl haircuts: RAFE and DANNY, 10\nyears old.\n\nRAFE\nBandits at 2 o'clock.\n\nDANNY\nPower dive!\n\nThey buzz their lips in a flying noise and work the controls,\nRafe's bare feet on one pedal, Danny's on the other.\n\nRAFE\nIt's Germans!\n\nDANNY\nKill the bastards!\n\nRafe looks at Danny in shock -- then they both laugh and go\nright back into their game, manufacturing their own machine\ngun and engine sounds.\n\nRAFE\nGood shooting, Danny!\n\nDANNY\nGood shooting, Rafe!\n\nRAFE\nLand of the free...\n\nDANNY\nHome of the brave!\n\nRAFE\nThere's another one!\n\nTheir vocal motors roar again...

But a man's hand grabs Danny\nby the straps of his overalls and jerks him from the cockpit. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\nIt's Danny's FATHER and he's a fearsome sight; drunk, his\nhair uncombed, his face unshaven, his teeth -- those still\nleft -- are rotting. He's also missing an arm; but the one\nthat's left is potent, and he's shaking Danny with it.\n\fDANNY'S FATHER\nYou no count boy! Johnson come lookin',\nsaid he'd pay a dime for you to shovel\nhis pig shed, and I can't find you no\nplace.\n\nDANNY\nDaddy, I told you I was comin' here.\n\nHis father slaps him off his feet. Rafe is so horrified he\ncan't get a sound out. Danny isn't even surprised. But when\nhis father snatches him up again, twisting the overall straps\nso tight they choke him, he struggles. It does no good; his\nfather starts marching across the field, dragging and\nstrangling Danny.\n\nDANNY\nDa!... Dad...\n\nThe father's drunken anger makes him oblivious -- until\nCRACK! The 2x4 propeller slams him across the back, knocking\nhim to the ground and making him drop Danny.\n\nThe father rolls over to see 10-year-old Rafe, holding the\n2x4 like a bat.\n\nRAFE\nLet him alone!\n\nThe father's eyes bulge in rage; he struggles to his feet.\n\nDANNY\nRafe... Daddy... No!\n\nThe man looks murderous, but Rafe draws back the board.\n\nRAFE\nI'll bust you open, you...German!\n\nThe words ring something deep in the man's booze-broken\nbrain. He begins to cough, convulsively; it brings a blossom\nof blood to his mouth. He wipes it with his hand, but blood\nclings to his teeth. He chokes out --\n\nDANNY'S FATHER\nI fought the Germans.\n\nHe looks at Danny in shame, with the realization of what he's\njust done. He turns and staggers away.\n\nDanny looks at Rafe -- a communication between boys joined by\nsomething deeper than blood. Then Danny runs off after his\nfather.\n\nDANNY\nDaddy! Daddy! wait.\n\fDanny catches him, takes his father's hand, and walks away\nwith him.\n\nThe crop duster we saw in the air has just landed, behind\nRafe.",

His father looks toward Danny and his father,\nwalking away, then looks at his own son.\n\nRAFE'S FATHER\nHey, boy -- you wanna go up?\n\nRafe can't believe it; he runs to the plane and hops into his\nfather's lap. As his father cranks the engine and tucks him\ninto the harness, Rafe says --\n\nRAFE\nDaddy, sometime will you take Danny up\ntoo?\n\nRAFE'S FATHER\nSure will, son.\n\nThe engine races to life...and we --\nDISSOLVE TO:\nEXT.

The TRAINING CAPTAIN, watching through\nbinoculars on the ground, talks into his RADIO --\n\nTRAINING CAPTAIN\nMcCawley! Walker! Cut that out!\n\fRAFE\nI thought this was a training flight.\nI'm just trying to give Danny some\ntraining.\n\nDANNY\nNot on your best day, boy!\n\nRafe grins and guns his plane low, in the opposite direction\nhe was moving before.
