In the front passenger seat is MICAH TOMES, a BLIND Man. \nDAN RICHARDSON, a Homicide Detective, who was standing near the body, walks to the car and greets Micah as he steps out.]\nDAN: I'm glad you could come, Micah. \nMICAH: You sounded pretty serious on the phone. \n[The two men walk away from the others so that Dan can quietly bring Micah up to speed.]\nDAN: I hadn't seen anything like this in awhile. \n(beat)\nAlmost ten years.\n[Micah's head snaps up a bit in understanding.]\nDAN: There's a dead girl on the ground over there…and there's no blood left in her body.

There wasn't much I could do…after…\n[He lets the thought trail off, half-finished.]\nMICAH: Can I get a little closer to the body?\n[Two officers carry the body on a stretcher with a plastic sheet over it. Dan motions for them to stop and lifts the sheet. Micah moves toward it and reaches out, finding, then gently stroking the dead girl's forehead. \nHe nods to Dan and Dan gestures for the officers to take the girl away. Alone again, Micah lifts his hand and gently smells it]\nMICAH: I don't think you're going to have much choice, Dan. You'll need Jack's help on this. \n[He starts to turn away]\nDAN: I thought this was all over a long time ago…\n\nMICAH: You knew before you ever asked me to come here. It's starting all over again. \n\nDAN: How can you be so…certain?\n\nMICAH: Because I'm not looking with my eyes.\n(beat)\nWhoever killed this girl was already dead themselves.\n[Dan walks away with Micah toward the squad car and the camera settles low to the ground, \nnear the outline of where the body had lain]\nMICAH: A lot of people don't know about evil.

Lying amongst the charred rubble, we see a Russian Soldier. He is dead; his \nthroat ripped out, his vacant eyes stare upward. CONTINUE the DOLLY and we see the lifeless form of a \nyoung man, perhaps eighteen years old. He too has blood spattered on his neck and it is clear that he is \nno longer alive. A dark shape moves nearer-one that at first we did not notice, but had taken as part \nof the debris. The shape turns, and we see it is a man; a wild, wide-eyed expression on his face, his \nvictims' blood stains his chin. In an instant, he darts out of view and the camera pans up to the \ndarkness of night.\nOPENING CREDITS.]\nBack to Top\nScene 2: Russian Occupied Northern Afghanistan, August 1989 \nCUT TO:\nEXT.

The half-track is very close to a small boulder-covered hill as it lumbers to a halt.\nSuddenly, the air is filled with the sound of incoming artillery and the halftrack is rocked from the explosion.\nRUSSIAN SOLDIERS mill about, trying to see where their attackers are. \nA billowing cloud of dust explodes within a dozen feet of the \"driver's side\" of the vehicle. \nAS THE SMOKE CLEARS, we see a MAN, FROST, standing on a distant ridge, a ROCKET PROPELLED GRENADE LAUNCHER in his hands.\nThe RUSSIAN COMMANDER madly gestures for the big 50 CAL MACHINE GUN to aim at the attacker.]\nRUSSIAN COMMANDER: Shoot him!

Jack and Nat are followed, with the Hind going into a strafing run. They manage to avoid getting shot and the helicopter overtakes them, passing them up. They only have a few seconds to prep a Rocket Propelled Grenade before the Pilot turns his craft back on them.\nNat tosses the grenade to Frost, who loads the launcher.\nThe Hind wheels around to take another shot at the two men.\nFrost takes aim…slowly…he'll only have one shot at this. Just before the gunner can aim, Frost fires the rocket, blowing the helicopter out of the sky in a Fiery explosion. \nWalking through the wreckage, we see the Pilot's HULA GIRL, now singed and melting, lying on the ground. \nA hand (Nat's) reaches down and picks it up.]\n[Dissolve to:\nCRANE SHOT of FROST and FOUR OTHER MERCENARIES walking down on the other side of the ridge.

This is 1940's American technology. Shit'll run forever.

A RAT scurries by in the foreground.\nWE HEAR an incessant DRIPPING noise in the background. Frost proceeds into the tunnels, cautiously playing his flashlight on the walls around him.\nDRIP DRIP DRIP\nEVENTUALLY, he comes to an area where the tunnels BRANCH into THREE. Not knowing which to take, he leans toward the first, straining to catch any sound that might lead him to Nat.\nDRIP DRIP DRIP\nIt's the same at the second tunnel entrance.\nPausing at the third, we hear Frost's own breathing, heightened by the otherwise silent labyrinth.\nAll we hear is Frost's own breathing, heightened by the otherwise silent labyrinth.\nHis gun held high, he strains to listen again. \nNow, in addition to the dripping sound, we hear the faint sound of a distant fluttering, then it builds as the source comes CLOSER.\nOUT of the INKY BLACKNESS of the tunnel, we see a swarm of black shapes streaking toward Frost. \nBATS.\nThere must be close to a hundred of them, a flurry of leathery-winged creatures with twin needles for teeth. Frost reacts, trying to knock them away, keeping them from his face. The bats attack for a time, one makes contact with his face, scratching him--he strikes another with his fist, sending it back into the water. Finally, they pass him, moving on down the tunnel. Frost gets himself together, then continues. \nAs he rounds a corner, we see that there's a crack in the side of the tunnel and a thin glimmer of light is escaping.

Is that you? \n(beat)\nIt has been a very long time, my son. Perhaps five years…\n\nNAT: Five years.\n(beat)\nThere's been a lot of death in five years, Father. A LOT of death. I've killed more than a few men.\n\nPRIEST: War is a terrible thing, but it is not unknown to Him.
