He is boiling an\n\negg, which he takes out of boiling water and puts on a\nsparkling clean plate.\n\nMICHAEL puts the yolk-stained egg-cup and plate into the\nsink, his breakfast eaten, then, as noiseless as he can,\nturns on the tap to run water.

I was at a\nconference in Boston.\n\nILANA\nYou're a lawyer?\n\nMICHAEL\nYes.\n\nILANA\n\nI was intrigued by your letter but\nI can’t say I wholly understood it.\nYou attended the trial?\n\nMICHAEL\nYes. Almost twenty years ago. I was\na law student. I remember you, I\nremember your mother very clearly.\n\f77.\n\nILANA\nMy mother died in Israel - a good\nmany years ago.\n\nMICHAEL\nI’m sorry.\n\nMICHAEL hesitates for a moment.\n\nILANA\nGo on, please.\n\nMICHAEL\nPerhaps you heard. Hanna Schmitz\nrecently died. She killed herself.\n\nILANA shakes her head.\n\nILANA\nShe was a friend of yours?\n\nMICHAEL\nA kind of friend. It’s as simple as\nthis. Hanna was illiterate for the\ngreater part of her life.\n\nILANA\nIs that an explanation of her\nbehaviour?\n\nMICHAEL\nNo.\n\nILANA\nOr an excuse?\n\nMICHAEL shakes his head.\n\nMICHAEL\nNo. No. She taught herself to read\nwhen she was in prison. I sent her\ntapes. She’d always liked being\nread to.\n\nILANA shifts slightly.\n\nILANA\nWhy don’t you start by being honest\nwith me? At least start that way.\nWhat was the nature of your\nfriendship?\n\fMICHAEL\nWhen I was young I had an affair\nwith Hanna.\n\nILANA looks at him for a moment.\n\nILANA\nI’m not sure I can help you, Mr.\nBerg. Or rather, even if I could\nI’m not willing to.\n\nMICHAEL\nI was almost sixteen when I took up\nwith her. The affair only lasted a\nsummer. But.\n\nILANA\nBut what?\n\nMICHAEL just looks at her.\n\nILANA\nI see. And did Hanna Schmitz\nacknowledge the effect she’d had on\nyour life?\n\nMICHAEL stares back, understood for the first time.\n\nMICHAEL\nShe'd done much worse to other\npeople. I’ve never told anyone.\n\nILANA\n\nPeople ask all the time what I\nlearned in the camps.",

ILANA\n\nPeople ask all the time what I\nlearned in the camps. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\n But the camps\nweren’t therapy. What do you think\nthese places were? Universities? We\ndidn’t go there to learn. One\nbecomes very clear about these\nthings.\n\nILANA looks at him, unrelenting.\n\nILANA\nWhat are you asking for?\nForgiveness for her? Or do you just\nwant to feel better yourself? My\nadvice, go to the theatre, if you\nwant catharsis. Please. Go to\nliterature. Don't go to the camps.\nNothing comes out of the camps.\nNothing.\n\n78.\n\f79.\n\nILANA looks at him, unrelenting.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhat she wanted...what she wanted\nwas to leave you her money. I have\nwith me.\n\nILANA\nTo do what?\n\nMICHAEL\nAs you think fit.\n\nMICHAEL reaches for his briefcase. He takes out the lavender\ntea-tin, which he sets down on the table in front of ILANA.\n\nMICHAEL\nHere.\n\nILANA lifts the tin.\n\nILANA\nWhen I was a little girl, I hada\ntea-tin for my treasures. Not quite\nlike this. It had Cyrillic\nlettering. I took it with me to the\ncamp, but it got stolen.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhat was in it?\n\nILANA\nOh. Sentimental things. A piece of\nhair from our dog. Some tickets to\noperas my father had taken me to.\nIt wasn’t stolen for its contents.\nIt was the tin itself which was\nvaluable, what you could do with\nit.\n\nShe sits a moment, overcome, her hand on the tin.\n\nILANA\n\nThere’s nothing I can do with this\nmoney. If I give it to anything\nassociated with the extermination\nof the Jews, then to me it will\nseem like absolution and that is\nsomething I’m neither willing nor\nin a position to grant.\n\nMICHAEL nods slightly.\n\f80.\n\nMICHAEL\nI was thinking maybe an\norganization to encourage literacy.\n\nILANA\nGood.\nThere’s a silence.\nILANA\nGood.\nMICHAEL\nDo you know if there’s a Jewish\norganization?\nILANA\n\nI‘ll be surprised if there isn’t.\n\nThere’s a Jewish organisation for\n\neverything.
