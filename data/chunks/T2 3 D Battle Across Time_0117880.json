It's a 1940s HOLLYWOOD OFFICE BUILDING that\nmight have been commissioned by Howard Hughes in his\nprime.  The SIGN over the ENTRANCE reads:\n\n\t\t\t\tCyberdyne Systems\n\nThe graphic style is hi-tech modern, indicating that\nCyberdyne must be a new tenant.  But even more compelling\nis the SIGN that \"morphs\" out of the concrete in front of\nthe building.  Rising on a pylon, the sign lets us know\nwhat we're really here to see:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tT2/3D\n\nWe walk through the doors into the dark, chilly lobby.\n\nINTERIOR QUEUE: CYBERDYNE LOBBY\n\nOnce inside the building, it's as though we've stepped\ninto another world.  All traces of the gracious 1940s\ndesign have been obliterated by the current tenant.\n\nThe CYBERDYNE LOBBY is an ultramodern statement in\npolished gray concrete, with a rustic terrazzo floor.  The\nCyberdyne Systems LOGO hangs on the back wall.  A smaller\nSIGN inside the lobby reads:\n\n\t\t\t\tCYBERDYNE SYSTEMS\n   Special Projects Division - Authorized Personnel Only\n\n\t\t\t\tTODAY'S SCHEDULE:\n\t\tDemonstration of New Technologies\n\t\t\t\tInvited Guests Only\n\nWe enter the QUEUE AREA, a cheerless world of polished\ngray concrete and brushed stainless steel accents.  A\nnumber of smoked plastic DOMES hang from the ceiling,\npresumably concealing surveillance cameras.\n\nVIDEO MONITORS suspended from the ceiling carry an endless\ncycle of information programs.  These depict the history\nof Cyberdyne, the history of Cyberdyne's robotic\ndevelopment program, and so forth.  The videos are both\nserious and humorous.\n\nBeyond the lobby, we find the entrance to another room.
