She turns and we finally SEE her face.\nThis is ADELAIDE, and she has Down Syndrome.\n\nTWO BOYS, TEN, bash a gate open with a baseball bat and strut\ninto the yard. This is Troy and Bryan...the Rutger twins.\n\nTROY\nHey, retard.\n\nThey head into the empty derelict house, on a mission.\nAdelaide suddenly speaks.\n\nADELAIDE\nExcuse me.\n\nThey stop, turn.\n\nADELAIDE (CONT'D)\nYou’re going to die in there.\n\nThey stare at her a beat, the moment is shocking.

The flashlights\nilluminate a wall of dusty SPECIMEN JARS filled with yellow\nviscous fluid. Within the fluid: monstrosities. Severed\ndeformed hands, feet, a twisted jaw...a horrifying tableau in\nthe style of Joel Peter Witkin.\n\nNext to the jars: a neat line of surgical equipment. Clamps,\ndisembowelers, spreaders...all caked in rusty blood.\n\nA moment of awe from the boys. WE SEE (but they don’t)\nsomething move behind them.

OLD VICTORIAN HOUSE -- DAY\n\nThey pull into the driveway. Everyone takes a good look --\nit’s looking better than it did the last time we saw it. New\npaint, shutters, gutters. There’s a FOR SALE sign on the\nlawn. All three of them take it in as they come to a stop.\n\nBEN\nThis is it.\n\nVivien is unsure. Violet is intrigued.
