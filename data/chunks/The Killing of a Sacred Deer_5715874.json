When the\nboy’s actions become increasingly sinister, Steven’s ideal life starts\nto fall apart and he is forced to make an unthinkable sacrifice.\n\fINT. HOSPITAL - OPERATING THEATRE - MORNING\n\nSTEVEN, a cardiothoracic surgeon, around 45 years old,\nMATTHEW, an anaesthetist of around 55, and three SURGICAL\nNURSES are leaning over the chest of a patient. They are\nperforming open heart surgery. We follow the surgical\ninstruments as they explore the patient’s internal organs.\nThe surgeon’s movements are precise, considered. The\nprocedure unfolds in perfect synchronicity. No one misses a\nbeat. The only sounds are the clink of metal instruments, the\ndoctors’ breathing, and the electronic beep of the heart\nmonitor.\n\nBLACK SCREEN - OPENING CREDITS\n\nINT. HOSPITAL - SURGERY PREPARATION ROOM - MORNING\n\nSteven and Matthew stand at a sink, washing their hands.\nTheir scrubs are splattered with blood. The overhead lighting\nis harsh. The anaesthetist takes his watch out of his pocket\nand puts it on. The surgeon takes the anaesthetist’s hand and\nstudies his watch.\n\nSteven\nNice watch.\n\nMatthew\nThanks.\n\nSTEVEN\nWhat’s the water resistance?\n\nMATTHEW\n200 metres.\n\nSteven\nIt also has a date display.\n\nMATTHEW\nYes, it does.\n\nSTEVEN\nI might have gone for a metal strap\ninstead of a leather strap.\n\nMATTHEW\nOh, really?\n\nSTEVEN\nYes.",

I’ve been thinking about\ngetting a new one for a while now.\n\nMATTHEW\nThink about it. We can go together\nto the place where I bought it. If\nI tell them you’re a colleague of\nmine, a friend, they'll definitely\ngive you a better price. Both the\nowner and his father have been\npatients of mine, so I know them\nquite well. Think about it.\n\nSteven looks at Matthew’s watch again. He smiles almost\nimperceptibly and with a nod assures Matthew that he will\nthink about it. The anaesthetist leaves the room.\n\nINT. HOSPITAL - STEVEN'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON\n\nSteven unlocks the door to his office. A small room with two\nchairs, a two-seater sofa, and a metal locker. He opens the\nlocker, takes off his white coat and hangs it up. He puts on\na blazer and picks up his leather briefcase.\n\nINT. BURGER KING - AFTERNOON\n\nSteven sits in a Burger King, waiting for someone. He sips a\nsoft drink. There are barely any customers, it’s a slow time\nof day. On the table in front of him is a small piece of\napple pie. MARTIN, a teenage boy, rushes over to Steven's\ntable. His face is flushed and his T-shirt is patchy with\nsweat. Martin, around 15, is dressed like a typical teenager.\nHe has a nondescript face, not particularly likeable but not\nunlikeable either.\n\nMARTIN\nHi.\n\nSTEVEN\nHi.\n\nMARTIN\n\nSorry to keep you waiting.

He switches the\nringer to silent and ignores the call. He watches the boy as\nhe waits for his order. Martin comes back. Steven watches\nMartin while he eats. The boy eats very methodically.

Don’t worry.\n\nEXT. SEASIDE ROAD - AFTERNOON\n\nSteven and Martin are standing beside the car. It is parked\nnear the sea. The weather is fine, the sea calm. A few people\nare swimming. The boy takes off his jacket.\n\nMARTIN\nSorry I was late today, Steven.\n\nSTEVEN\nIt doesn’t matter.\n\nMARTIN\nI was at a friend’s house. He got a\nnew motorbike and I wanted to check\nit out.
