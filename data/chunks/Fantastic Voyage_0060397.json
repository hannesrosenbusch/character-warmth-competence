As the plane lands:\n\n3B\tEXT. HUGE HANGAR\n\n\tTroop carriers filled with ARMED SOLDIERS are lined up before the\n\thangar; several official cars filled with SECRET SERVICE MEN, four\n\tMOTORCYCLE POLICEMEN, and a caravan of three limousines complete the\n\twaiting entourage. The CHIEF of the SECRET SERVICE looks toward the\n\tairfield as the plane is heard taxiing in. He turns and gets into one\n\tof the limousines, followed by the others.\n\n3C\tLONG SHOT - VEHICLES ON AIRFIELD\n\n\tComing toward camera. The plane looms in the f.g. A motorized stairway\n\tis on the way toward the door of the plane. The vehicles come to a\n\thalt before the camera.\n\n3D\tHIGH ANGLE SHOT - PLANE\n\n\tThe Armed Soldiers leap out of the troop carriers and form a cordon\n\taround the plane. The Secret Service Men get out within the circle of\n\tguards, wait for the door to open.\n\n4\tEXT. JET DOOR\n\n\tIt opens. GRANT steps out: in middle thirties, with the air of a man\n\twho takes nothing seriously -- his coverup for involvement. He turns\n\tto help JAN BENES out of the plane. Benes is Mittel European in dress\n\tand manner. Physically, he is Schweitzer at forty: the leonine head,\n\tthe shock of hair. He carries a battered suitcase. In response to\n\tGrant's gesture, he precedes him down the stairs.",

In response to\n\tGrant's gesture, he precedes him down the stairs. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n5\tON THE FIELD\n\n\tAs Benes reaches the last step, he is greeted by the Chief of the\n\tSecret Service, who shakes his hand, introduces him to several of his\n\tsubordinates, and leads him to a limousine. Their words are lost in\n\tthe din of jets. About to get into the car, Benes turns and moves back\n\tquickly to Grant, who is near the bottom of the stairs. Benes extends\n\this hand. They shake warmly. Benes moves back toward the limousine.\n\n6\tGRANT - ON PLATFORM STAIRS\n\n\tHe watches as Benes gets into the limousine and the caravan takes off\n\twith the Motorcycle Escort. The Soldiers are climbing back into the\n\ttroop carriers. Grant starts down the stairs, is lost to view in the\n\tgeneral activity.\n\n7-\t<OUT>\n8\n\n8A\tEXT.

DESERTED STREET (BACK LOT)\n\n\tA rundown area. The cavalcade starts down the street. In the second\n\tfloor of an otherwise dark house, a light is turned on and off, an\n\tevident signal. PAN DOWN to a heavy car, waiting in a narrow alley\n\twhich opens into the street. Its headlights are off, the sound of its\n\tengine completely drowned by the concerted roar of the oncoming cars\n\tand motorcycles. As the cavalcade nears the entrance to the alley, one\n\tof the motorcyles comes speeding up from the rear of the escort. The\n\tcar in the alleyway starts toward the entrance to the alley.\n\n9-\t<OUT>\n15\n\n15A\tEXT. ALLEYWAY\n\n\tThe car starts hurtling forward at full speed. The front of the\n\tlimousine is now visible. A broadside impact seems inevitable.\n\n15B\tEXT.

It hits the motorcycle\n\t-- a totally unexpected obstruction -- and sends the Policeman flying\n\tout of scene. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n It is sufficient to deflect the kamikaze car from its\n\tdeadly aim. The car hits the rear of the limousine, sends it spinning\n\tout of control. The suicide car, also out of control, careens toward\n\tthe opposite side of the street. The limousine smashes into a\n\ttelephone pole, which brings it to a jolting stop.\n\n16\tINT. LIMOUSINE\n\n\tThe impact throws Benes to the side. His head hits the door handle\n\twith stunning force, almost knocking him out.\n\n17\tEXT. STREET\n\n\tThe kamikaze car slams directly into a brick wall. It instantly bursts\n\tinto fire, engulfing the Driver. The fitful flames illuminate the\n\totherwise dark street.\n\n18\tEXT. LIMOUSINE\n\n\tThe Chief of the Secret Service jumps out of the limousine, waves to a\n\tsedan to pull up, his shouts lost in the general turmoil. Other Secret\n\tService Men are helping the dazed Benes out, shielding him. A sedan\n\tpulls up beside the limousine.\n\n19\tINT. SEDAN\n\n\tThe Chief of the Secret Service instantly hustles Benes into the rear.\n\tAs he climbs in beside him, and the other Secret Service Men rush to\n\tthe other side to get in, there is the sharp crack of a rifle shot. It\n\tshatters the rear window of the sedan, narrowly missing Benes. The\n\tChief thrusts him onto the floor, sprawls on top of Benes to cover\n\thim, while shouting to the Driver to get going, his words\n\tindistinguishable in the confusion of more rifle shots, which sends\n\tglass and bullets ricocheting through the interior of the sedan.\n\n20\tEXT. STREET\n\n\tIn the eerie light of the burning car, the sedan can be seen speeding\n\toff, flanked and spearheaded by Motorcycle Police. The Secret Service\n\tMen and those in the sedans are left behind, firing toward the top\n\tfloor of a nearby bullding from which the rifle fire came.\n\n21\tSERIES OF IMPRESSIONISTIC CUTS THROUGH CREDITS\n\n\tWithout divulging the nature of the hospital, the unconscious Jan\n\tBenes is seen undergoing a fast and thorough medical probe by\n\tTECHNICIANS and SPECIALISTS, using the latest equipment.",

CAR\n\n\tSeated in the rear, Grant looks as if he has just been aroused from\n\tsleep and hustled into the car in a hurry. He is getting into his\n\tshirt, helped by a MAN beside him. There is a smudge of lipstick on\n\this cheek.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\t\tSorry we had to get you up at this\n\t\t\thour, Mr. Grant.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\t\t\t(yawning)\n\t\t\tI thought I was on my vacation...\n\t\t\tWhat's it all about?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\t\tI can't tell you.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\t\tWhere we going?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\t\tI can't tell you that either...\n\t\t\tExcuse me, Mr. Grant, but you've got\n\t\t\ta smudge on your cheek.\n\n\tHe takes out handkerchief, realizing Grant can't see it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\t\tMay I?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\t\tGo ahead.\n\n\tAs Grant finishes buttoning on his shirt, the Man rubs off the\n\tlipstick.

Then they stop and look at\n\tit. For a moment nothing happens, then the ground seemingly starts to\n\tsink with the car.\n\n21F\tINT. CAR\n\n\tGrant is startled to see the earth sliding up past the car.\n\n21G\tLONG SHOT - ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n\tIt now becomes apparent that the car has been resting on what is\n\treally the top of an elevator shaft. The sides of the shaft now become\n\tvisible: it is seemingly bottomless.\n\n21H\tINT. CAR - IN SHAFT\n\n\tGrant responds as the elevator finally comes to a halt.\n\n22-\t<OUT>\n39\n\n40\tINT. BOTTOM OF ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n\tThe car is on the earthen platform. Two big doors open. A scooter\n\tbearing the distinctive insignia of the <CMDF> appears, driven by an\n\tM.P. wearing the same emblem. Grant gets out of the car, is waved by\n\tthe M.P. into the scooter. He gets in, is driven away.\n\n41\tINT. UNDERGROUND ORDNANCE DEPOT\n\n\tThey pass through a vast empty area, obviously capable of holding\n\tlarge pieces of equipment.

As the M.P. and Grant drive across the foyer, Grant eyes\n\tthe Female CMDFs appreciatively. Their uniforms emphasize non-military\n\tpoints. The scooter reaches:\n\n45\tINT. CLEARANCE DESK\n\n\tThe OFFICER behind the desk looks up.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOFFICER\n\t\t\tYour I.D. card, please.\n\n\tGrant takes out a card with only an embossed number. The Officer\n\tplaces it into an IDENTIFIER. We see its screen is blank.

The scooter takes off, speeding down a long neon-lit corridor,\n\tmarked off for scooter traffic: four lanes, two in each direction.\n\tNumerous doors leading to offices open on both sides of the walkways.\n\tTraffic is heavy.

His head is uncovered.\n\tThe full shock of hair stands out against the white pillow. His body\n\tis draped in the usual manner. A battery of SPECIALISTS and MEDICAL\n\tATTENDANTS, MALE and FEMALE, are moving about under the glare of beams\n\tfocused on the Operating Table.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\t\t\t(startled)\n\t\t\tBenes...
