In\nfront of her, a man falls from a bullet. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n His body stops mid\nstride, his chest jerking forward before he falls to the\nground. Many people get hit and drop one by one to the ground\nall around her. Some lie still while others crawl on their\nelbows trying to reach safety.\n\nLoung sees a man thrown into the air as the ground explodes\nbeneath him. Land mines. She keeps running. A woman with\nchild stands screaming. Another woman running knocks into her\nand the ground beneath them explodes. Loung runs staring at\nthe ground. What can she do? Bullets from behind, land mines\nunderneath. She holds her breath and moves forward. (Possibly\nmoves forward slowly because of mines. Could discuss slow\nmotion as world blows up around her and her heart beats)\n\nMinutes later-\nAfter she catches up with Chou and Kim, they see an old\n\nremnant of a tree stump. It sticks out of the ground three\nfeet tall by four feet wide. They crouch behind it.\n\f80.\n\nEXT. TREE STUMP - DAY\n\nChou covers her ears with her hands and squeezes her eyes\nshut. Kim is white, leaning against the tree for support.\nThey stay there for what seems like hours until all is quiet\nagain.\n\nLater-\n\nWhen they believe it is safe, they come out from behind the\ntree stump.\n\nLoung watches Chou and Kim trudge ahead, their eyes focusing\non the ground.\n\nThere are smoldering remains of bonfires giving off the\nstench of burnt human flesh all through the village. Trails\nand puddles of blood stain the area. Her eyes are on the\nground wherever she goes, steering clear of anything that\nlooks like a grenade or land mine. They try to step into the\nfootprints of others.\n\nEXT. BORDER CAMP - DAY\nA month or so later. They have moved with others up to a more\nmountainous region where it is safe. Chou and Loung at the\nriver. Life is returning. We can see that aid relief is\nbeginning to trickle in.\nEXT. BORDER CAMP - DAY\nKim arrives at the site all flushed and out of breath.\nAs he explains this, Loung hears every other word\nKIM\n(out of breath)\nA Khmer Rouge soldier. They caught\nhim. (Pointing) They are taking him\nup there.",

Chou resists.\nLoung heads off on her own.\n\nEXT. BORDER CAMP - DAY\n\nLoung makes her way towards the sound until she closes in on\na mob of people.\n\f81.\n\nTheir bodies block her view of the prisoner. She tries to\nshift her body to find an open space but she cannot.\nFrustrated, she wedges her small body between theirs and\npushes her way through. She is in the middle of the crowd,\nsurrounded by people. She cannot see anything. She looks up\nto the faces of the adults who are all looking in the same\ndirection. Some are staring at him overwhelmed with emotion,\nunable to speak. Some are full of rage.\n\nFinally, she sees a clearing between people's legs. She tries\nto push her way through, but they are so engrossed in what's\ngoing on that they do not move. Determined, she gets on her\nhands and knees, and crawls through the brown forest of legs\nup to the front.\n\nThere he is. Loung stands and finds herself almost face-to-\nface with him, separated by only ten feet. Automatically, she\nraises her scarf to cover her head and face. Her heart beats\nwildly. Fear seeps into her body. She peeks over her scarf.\nHe is looking at her.\n\nShe takes a step back, leaning into the crowd for protection.\nThe crowd vibrates with anticipation and energy, closing in\naround the prisoner. Loung’s hands close into fists.\n\nThe mans face reveals nothing. His lips do not beg for mercy.\nHe sits propped up on a high back chair on a gravel hill that\nserves as a stage. He is dark and wears the black clothes of\nthe Khmer Rouge. A rough hemp rope that binds his feet\ntogether. More rope straps him to the back of the chair, it\ncoils around him from the chest down to the stomach.\n\nCROWD\nMurderer!\n\nLoung stares at him full of hatred.\n\nLoung watches as sweat streams down his adams apple. He bends\nhis head, looks down at his feet again, knowing there is no\nway out.\n\nMany people are wailing and accusing the man of killing their\nloved ones. Begging him to answer for his crimes.",

Begging him to answer for his crimes. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\nA WOMAN, crying loudly, pushes her way to the front of the\ncrowd. She is young, in her mid twenties. Like Loung, she\nwears the Khmer Rouge clothes. Though tears fall from her\neyes, her face is angry.\n\nWOMAN\n(shaking with emotion)\nI know this soldier. He killed my\nhusband and my sons. I know this\nman.\n\f82.\n\nTears in her eyes. In her hand she holds a weapon, its wooden\nhandle worn and splintered. Loung no longer listening. She is\nfixated on the prisoner. He looks up briefly when the women\ncomes forth, but now he is back in position, head down, eyes\nto the ground.\n\nLoung watches as the woman walks up to him, her weapon in\nhand. She stands in front of him, staring at the top of his\nhead. Loung wants to shield her eyes from what's about to\nhappen, but she can’t. The woman's hands shake as she raises\nthe weapon high above her head.\n\n(FLASH OF PA BEING HIT.)\nThe woman raises her weapon again.\nThe crowd is silenced.\n\nAn OLDER WOMAN reaches for her to stop her. She pushes her\naway. A man steps forward angry and is held back by another.\nThere is pain and chaos. Screaming and tears.\n\nBlood splatters the woman's clothes, and face. She screams\nand swings the weapon up above her head again. (Flash of\nLoung with a weapon. A surreal moment) Blood droplets land on\nLoung’s pants and face as she stands watching. Loung watches\nas the prisoners leg jerks but is held down by the rope. The\nKhmer Rouge body convulses and trembles, as if electricity is\ntraveling to the legs, arms, and fingers.\n\nThe Older Woman grabs her and holds her. She regains her\ncomposure. The Older Woman speaks with passion about how the\nCambodian people will not be destroyed by this. That she will\nnot become hateful like the KR.\n\nThen the Woman drops the weapon and they begin to walk away.\nWhen they turn around, Loung sees that she looks like death\nherself.

All the pain.\n\nBORDER CAMP - EARLY MORNING\n1979\nSun rises over the large camp.\n\nLoung watches a young man who was a victim of a land-mine\nmonths ago. Now he helps to build a small hut. She is in awe\nof his strength and agility with his loss of limbs.\n\nShe looks around the camp. Some people have already changed\ninto colorful clothes. More plastic tents.\n\nEXT. BORDER CAMP- EARLY MORNING\n\nLight rain falls on Loung’s small frame. Still in her old\nblack pants, she wears a new colorful shirt. Her hair is now\nlonger.\n\nShe balls up a handful of rice and rolls it into a banana\nleaf. She walks over to a woman sleeping alone under another\ntree. A small child lay nearby. She lays it down in front of\nher as a silent gift.\n\nEXT. BORDER CAMP - MORNING\n\nLike in the opening she walks and sees her reflection. This\ntime in the pond. She walks on towards a tree. She climbs up\na tree. She looks across the camp. She looks down at her\nfeet. So much has changed since her days in Phnom Penh.\n\nLoung hears Kim and looks up. She sees Kim walking towards\nher with two men. Afraid, she jumps down and takes a step\nback.\n\nShe can’t see clearly. Chou is also staring at the men. As\nthey comes closer they realize it is Meng and Khouy!\n\nChou runs to them and jumps into Khouy’s arms.",
