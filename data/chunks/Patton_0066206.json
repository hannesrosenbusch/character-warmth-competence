VIEW - DAY\n\nOur entire frame is filled with the image of an American\nflag, stretched tight. We hear a jumble of conversation\nin the b.g.3; then:\n\n_ VOICE\n{o.s.)\nAt-ten-shun!\n\nNow we hear the click of hundreds of boots. GENERAL\nGEORGE S. PATTON, JR. steps into our view; more than\nsix feet tall, he looms high against the b.g. of the\nflag. He glares down at us, the audience.\n\nA MILITARY BAND plays THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER, Patton\ncomes to a smart salute, and we watch him for the dura-\ntion of the entire anthem. He is straight and husky and\nas gaudy as a peacock. His helmet is lacquered and\nshines with four silver stars. He wears a tailored tunic,\nwith four stars on each shoulder, thirty brightly hued\ndecorations on the left breast, five horizontal and three\ndiagonal gold stripes on the sleeve. Beneath the tunic,\nhe wears a shirt with four stars on each lapel, making a\ntotal of twenty stars. A vivid blue sash is draped\nacross his breast, parallel to one of yellow, A red\ncollar sash weighted by another medal hangs from his neck.\nThe rest of his costume consists of a gold-buckled belt,\nwith his ivory-handled pistols on either side, riding\nbreeches, boots, and a riding crop. Four stars on the\nhandle of his pistols brings the grand total to twenty-\neight stars. On his fingers he wears four conspicuous\nrings.\n\nSERIES OF CUTS\n\nAs the anthem continues, we cut to a series of tight\nshots featuring various aspects of Patton's uniform and\ndecorations -- emphasizing the clusters of stars on his\nshoulders, his shirt, his pistols.\n\f66\n\nCLOSE SHOT - PATTON\n\nThe anthem concludes and he completes his salute.",

In\n& vibrant voice, and with a cold, mean look, he speaks\ndirectly at us:\n\nPATTON\n\nAt ease, men. I want you to remember\nthat no bastard ever won a war by\ndying for his country, He won it by\nmaking the other poor dumb bastard\ndie for his country... Men, the stuff\nwe heard about America not wanting\nto fight, wanting to stay out of the\nwar, was a lot of horsedung. Americans\ntraditionally love to fight. All real\nAmericans love the sting of battle.\nWhen you were kids you all admired the\nchampion marble player, the fastest\nrunner, the big league ballplayers, the\ntoughest boxers. Americans love a\n\n. Winner and do not tolerate a loser.\nAmericans play to win all the time.\nI wouldn't give a hoot in hell for a\nman who lost and laughed. That's why\nAmericans have never lost, and will\nnever lose a war, for the very thought\nof losing is hateful to Americans,\nAn army is a team. It lives, sleeps,\neats, fights as a team. This individu-\nality stuff is a lot of crap. The\nbilious bastards who wrote that stuff\nabout individuality for the Saturday\nEvening Post don't know any more about\nreal battle than they do about a sock\nfull of silt. We have the finest\nfood, equipment, the best spirit and\nmen in the world. Why, by God, I\nactually pity those poor bastards\nwe're going against -- by God, I do,\nWe won't just shoot the bastards.\nWe're going to cut out their living\nguts and use them to grease the\ntreads of our tanks. We're going to\nmurder those lousy Hun bastards by\nthe bushel. Many of you boys are\nwondering whether you'll chicken out\nunder fire. Don't worry about it;\nI can assure you you will all do your\nduty. The Nazis are the enemy. Wade\ninto them and spill their blood,\nShoot them in the belly. When you\nstick your hand into a bunch of goo\nthat a moment before was your best\nfriend's face...you'li know what to\n\nCont.\n\n \n\f@\n\n66\n\n9 Cont.",

There's another thing I want you\nto remember. I don't want to get any\nmessages saying: 'We are holding our\nposition.' We're not holding anything.\nLet the Hun do that. We are advancing\nconstantly and are not interested in\nholding anything, except onto the\nenemy. We're going to hold onto him\nby the nose and kick him in the ass.\nWe'll kick the hell out of him all\nthe time. We'll go through them like\ncrap through a goose.\n\npause)\nThere's one thing you men will be able\nto say when you get home. You may all\nthank God for it, Thirty years from\nnow, when you are sitting around the\nfireside with your grandson on your\nknee and he asks what you did in the\ngreat World War II, you won't have to\nsay, 'I shoveled shit in Louvisiana.'\n\n(pause)\nAll right -- now you sonsuvbitches\nkmow how I feel. I will be proud to\nlead you wonderful guys into battle\nanytime, anywhere\n\nHe stares sincerely, almost wet-eyed at us for a moment.\n\nPATTON\nThat is all.\n\n—_—\nNOTE: TITLES TO RUN OVER SCENES 10 - 12\n\nEXT.
