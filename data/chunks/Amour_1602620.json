Cautiously, he\n\n          lowers her down and helps her sit herself straight.

The third\n\n           day after our arrival, there was\n\n           rice pudding for lunch. I hate rice\n\n           pudding. We sat at long tables in a\n\n           huge hall. I didn't want to eat the\n\n           stuff and the housemaster said to\n\n           me: You won't get up until you've\n\n           cleared your plate. So after the\n\n           meal everybody left the room, and I\n\n           remained seated, in tears. I had\n\n           made a secret pact with Mom. I was\n\n           to send her a postcard every week.\n\n                          (MORE)\n\n           64.\n\n                         \n\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\n\n           If I was pleased with the place I\n\n           was to draw some flowers on it, or\n\n           if not, some stars. She kept the\n\n           card; it was covered all over in\n\n           stars. After three hours, I was\n\n           allowed to leave the table. I went\n\n           up to my room, got into bed and had\n\n           a fever of 42 degrees. It was\n\n           diphtheria. They took me to the\n\n           nearest hospital where I was put in\n\n           an isolation ward, which meant that\n\n           Mom, when she came to visit me,\n\n           could only wave at me through a\n\n           window. At some point I lost that\n\n           postcard. It's a pity.\n\n                         \n\n          Anne has become ever calmer during Georges' story.

STIFLED SOUNDS from\n\n          Anne. Everything that can still move in her body starts to\n\n          move. Georges presses down heavily on the pillow, lies on it\n\n          with his whole weight, for a long time, until all Anne's\n\n          movements stop. Then he sits up, exhausted, and without\n\n          removing the pillow from her face, remains seated beside her.\n\n                         \n\n          SILENCE.\n\n                         \n\n          SCENE 55 - INT.

He ends up finding the one he was looking for. He\n\n          takes it out on its hanger. Closes the closet again.\n\n           65.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          Looks at the dress.

He\n\n          cuddles it against him, rolled up in the blanket, leans\n\n          against a wall, then holds it as if it were a baby.\n\n                         \n\n          SCENE 59 - INT.

Eva comes\n\n          into the apartment. Remains a long time beside the door.\n\n          Looks around her, ill at ease. Finally she hesitantly goes\n\n          into the bedroom.\n\n           67.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          Anne's twin bed isn't there any more.

Looks out of the window, feeling at a loss. Then she\n\n          heads toward the sofa and armchairs in the corner. On the\n\n          table lie the remains of a snack. Eva looks at the table,\n\n          turns again toward the open windows, through which we hear\n\n          STREET NOISE. Then she sits down, exhausted, in one of the\n\n          armchairs.
