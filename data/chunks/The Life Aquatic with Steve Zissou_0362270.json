A\nchunk of twisted steel rips into the roof, tearing open the\ncockpit. Glass shatters, and parts of the helicopter break\naway.\n\nNed turns to Zissou and smiles uncertainly. Zissou hesitates.\nNed shrugs and smiles more broadly. Zissou reaches out to Ned\nand puts his arm across Ned’s chest, bracing him. He says\nblankly:\n\nZISSOU\nThis is going to hurt.\n\nEXT.

Flowing water\ncasts shadows in patterns on their faces. Zissou is at the\nwheel. A depth-sounding ping echoes periodically.\n\nThere is a large, dead tuna with clusters of sparkling chips\namong its scales trailing at the end of a line behind them.\nZissou points it out to Jane:\n\nZISSOU\nI hooked a rhinestone bluefin on a rope\nto give him something to eat.\n\nJane nods.\nINSERT:\n\nThe dashboard control panel.
