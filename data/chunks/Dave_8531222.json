For- \n          midably handsome Bill Mitchell is fit and in his early forties.   \n          His wife Ellen, still in her early thirties, is considered a \n          classical beauty with a wide \"friendly\" smile that in certain \n          photographs seems just on the edge of wistful.  The dog frolics \n          around them as they wave to the press and smile for the world.  \n          Ozzie and Harriet for the Nineties with a bow to FDR and some \n          Camelot thrown in.\n\n          MOVING WITH them...\n\n          They stride arm in arm beneath the portico that leads to the \n          West Wing.  The band is still playing as they head under the \n          archway, disappearing from public view.    Then, instantly,  \n          as a handler rushes up and grabs the dog,  the smiles vanish.  \n          Bill lets go of Ellen and Ellen lets go of Bill.
