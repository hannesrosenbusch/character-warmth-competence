He wears a black\nturban, large, plastic sunglasses, and a determined look. A\nfifty-year-old businessman in a grey suit rides in the back.\nHe checks his watch and stares out the window, anxious. A\nmeter which looks like a slot-machine is mounted on the left\nside of the hood outside the windshield.\n\nThe taxi shoots along the edge of a market. It cuts in-\nbetween three bicycles and a buzzing scooter with a family of\nfour on it. The mother in a red sari rides side-saddle. The\ntaxi flies past two rickshaws stacked with table linens and\ndodges a cow walking in the street.\n\nEXT. DEPOT. DAY\n\nThe taxi skids around a corner and -- with one of the rear\ndoors already swinging open -- slides to a stop at the\nentrance to a train station. Vendors on the sidewalk sell\nfruits, vegetables, spices, pottery, textiles, etc. A man at\na stand makes fresh-squeezed sugar-cane juice.\n\nThe fifty-year-old man jumps out of the car carrying two\nSamsonite suitcases. The driver shouts something after him in\nHindi. The fifty-year-old man looks back at him uncertainly\nwithout stopping. He sprints into the building.\n\nINT. DEPOT.
