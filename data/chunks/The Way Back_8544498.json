BARRACKS, CAMP 105, SIBERIA -— NIGHT 3\n\nA long rectangular building, the walls lined with two\ntiered bunks of rough-hewn logs. In the centre - a metal\nstove with a chimney stretching out through the roof. A\ndim central bulb illuminates some 150 men, aged from 16\nto 60, most sitting or lying on their bunks. Some wear\nscraps of army uniform, or civilian clothing, others in\nprison issued padded jackets. Some, from the Asian\nterritories, still wear something of their national\ncostume. Included among them are groups of foreigners\nfrom recently occupied countries and a Babel of languages\ndrifts through the fetid air. It’s a wide ranging mix of\ntypes, of race, of class. They’re miserable, starving\nand ill. There is no camp camaraderie and they eye each\nother with indifference or suspicion. Most of these men\nare political prisoners, known as ‘Politicals’ or\n‘58ers’, after the section of the Soviet Penal Code that\nhas put them here.\n\nNear the stove, and contrasted with the ‘Politicals’, a\ngroup are gathered about a card game on a lower bunk.\nThese men look healthier, and are further distinguished\nby their tattoos.\n\n(CONTINUED)\n\fRevised 2/10/09 (Blue) 2.\nCONTINUED: 3\n\nThese are the URKI, some dozen of them, regular\ncriminals, and from their manner the undisputed masters\nof the block.\n\nSitting facing each other - VALKA, thirties, heavily\ntattooed, flash of a steel-caped tooth.
