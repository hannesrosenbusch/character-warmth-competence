SOPHIA AND VICTOR'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK -- NIGHT\nA well-decorated one-bedroom in the Meat Packing District.\n\nOPEN ON: Long strands of freshly made pasta hung to dry in\nthe living room. Hundreds of pieces. Draped off lamps, across\ntables, over chairs, everywhere. It's an extraordinary sight.\n\nAmongst this adornment of noodles, we find a beautiful young\nwoman on the couch working on a laptop, trying to\nconcentrate. She seems a bit distracted by the pasta that\nsurrounds her. She is SOPHIA MARCUS.\n\nSophia sighs as she looks up from her computer at the sounds\nof cooking that can be heard coming from the...\n\nINT. KITCHEN. WHERE:\n\nA man toils over a pot of simmering tomato sauce. He is a\nhandsome Italian-American with big brown eyes. He is VICTOR.\n\nVictor tastes the sauce he's cooking the way a sommelier\ntastes wine. Slow and deliberate. He's pleased but subdued.\n\nVictor carefully plates some of that fresh pasta with his\nsauce and takes it into the living room.\n\nSophia looks stressed out. She keeps glancing at what looks\nlike a draft of a magazine article, certain parts have been\nhighlighted. She's in the middle of typing something when\nVictor approaches with the plate of food.\n\nVICTOR\nHere, taste.\n\nSOPHIA\nOK, gimme a second.\n\nVictor waits impatiently as Sophia finishes typing. She sets\naside the article and dutifully takes a forkful and eats it.\nVictor watches her closely as she chews, tastes, swallows.\n\nSOPHIA\nDelicious. Your best yet. Really.\n\nSophia reaches for the article just as a piece of pasta slips\noff a lamp and falls onto the page. She picks it off.\n\nSophia's affirmation hasn't convinced Victor, he tastes just\nthe sauce as if trying to pinpoint a flaw.\n\nVICTOR\nThere's not too much garlic?\n\fSophia looks up from her laptop - a little annoyed.",

He's still standing there.\n\nVICTOR\nMaybe it needs more basil?\n\nSOPHIA\n(exasperated)\nVictor I'm saying it's delicious.\n\nVICTOR\nYou're saying it's delicious but\nyou're not telling me it's\ndelicious.\n\nSOPHIA\nSweetie, please, I have to finish\nthis, Bobby needs this tonight, I\nstill have to pack, could you think\nout loud in the kitchen? You're not\ndoing much for my concentration.\n\nRealization flashes in Victor's eyes. He tastes again.\n\nVICTOR\nThat's it. It's too concentrated.\n\nVictor plants a big kiss on a startled Sophia.\n\nVICTOR\nThanks babe.\n\nSophia shakes her head and goes back to work as Victor heads\ninto the kitchen muttering to himself.\n\nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING, NEW YORK -- MORNING\n\nThe doors of the building open. Sophia and Victor emerge. She\nis carrying a suitcase as he follows her reading a Gourmet\n\nMagazine. They walk down the steps to a waiting cab.\n\nVICTOR\nPassports?\n\fSOPHIA\nYep.\n\nVICTOR\nTickets?\n\nSOPHIA\nYep.\n\nVICTOR\nApartment reservation?\n\nSOPHIA\nYep.\n\nVICTOR\nEuros?\n\nSOPHIA\nYep.\n\nVICTOR\nSuitcase?\n\nThey reach the cab. She turns to him. Smirks.\n\nSOPHIA\nI have mine.\n\nHe looks down at his empty hands.\n\nVICTOR\nShit.\n\nHe runs back into the building as she puts her case in the\ntrunk and gets in the cab.\n\nINT. CAB -- LATER\n\nSophia waits. The trunk is slammed and Victor gets in.\n\nSOPHIA\nJFK please.\n\nVICTOR\nActually, sweetie, I just have to\nmake one stop.\n\nShe knows where. She just looks at him.\n\fINT. VICTOR'S RESTAURANT -- DAY\n\nThe restaurant is basically a building site.

BUILDERS are at work all around her.\n\nHer cell rings. She checks the ID. Takes a breath. Answers:\n\nSOPHIA\nHey Bobby.\n\nINT. MAGAZINE EDITOR'S OFFICE. WHERE:\n\nBOBBY BROOKS, editor-in-chief, a rotund, bald, but benevolent\nlooking man is talking on a wireless earpiece in a cluttered\noffice. He's looking at an 8x10 photograph of Donald Trump.\n\nBOBBY\nWhy can't we say Trump's comb over\nwraps around clockwise? I'm looking\nat the picture we're running with\nthe piece. It's wrapping clockwise.\n\nINTERCUT: Sophia has made her way outside the restaurant.\n\nSOPHIA\nYou can say it. You just can't\nstate it as a fact.\n\nBOBBY\nIt works better as a fact. It's a\nfun little detail. People love fun\nlittle details.\n\nSOPHIA\nI looked at every picture I could\nfind of him in the last ten years.\nI talked to his stylist. The hair\nchanges. It's a fact if you qualify\nwith \"usually\" or \"typically\"\n\nBOBBY\nPeople hate qualifiers.\n\nSophia shrugs as if to say \"What do you want me to say?\"\n\fSOPHIA\nThose are the facts.\n\nBOBBY\nYeah well your facts are getting in\nthe way of my fun.\n\nBobby sets the picture aside. A beat.\n\nSOPHIA\nHey. While I have you. I wanted to\ntalk you about something...\n\nSophia is pacing now. She's visibly nervous - like she's\ndebating whether or not to just get off the phone.\n\nBOBBY\nTalk.\n\nSOPHIA\nWell. I was thinking. Since I'm\ngoing to Italy already. Maybe I\ncould try doing a travel piece or\nsomething as a feature or--\n\nBOBBY\nI have writers that do travel\nfeatures. You don't do travel\nfeatures. You do fact checking.\n\nSOPHIA\nYeah.

My writers\ncount on you. They can't do what\nthey do unless you do what you do.\nYou're good at something, be happy\nfor that, be grateful for it, a lot\nof people are good at nothing.\n\nSOPHIA\nYeah. I guess. It's just--\n\fHis Assistant signals that Bobby needs to take the call.\nBOBBY\nKeep swinging in your wheelhouse.\nYou'll get more hits.\nShe sighs - deflated. Bobby suddenly remembers something.\nBOBBY\nOh and I need a table at Babbo this\nFriday. Can you take care of it?\nSOPHIA\nSeriously Bobby. You do know that\nyou have a new assistant?\nBOBBY\nI do. But she doesn't know the\nMaitre d'. You do. You got it?\n\nSOPHIA\nI got it.\n\nBOBBY\nYou're one in a million kid.\n\nHe rolls to that waiting call.\n\nINT. CAB -- LATER\n\nSophia sits staring out the window, lost in her thoughts.\nVictor gets in, breathless and excited.\n\nVICTOR\nVerona here we come.\n\nHe notices Sophia not sharing his enthusiasm.\n\nVICTOR\nWhat's wrong?\n\nSophia just kind of shakes her head as if to say \"nothing\".\n\nVICTOR\nWhat'd Bobby want?\n\nSOPHIA\nTo argue about which direction\nTrump's comb over wraps.\n\nVICTOR\nCounter clockwise?\n\fSOPHIA\nHe still treats me like I'm his\nassistant. He'll always treat me\nlike I'm his assistant.\n\nVICTOR\nIt's not that bad. He values you.\nHey, you've got job security right?\nShe just looks at him.\n\nSOPHIA\nRight.\n\nContent he's made her feel better Victor dives back into his\nGourmet Magazine. They ride in silence.

And I appreciate it.\n\nVICTOR\nYou'd be great in fine dining.\n\nSOPHIA\nSo I've been told... by you.\n\nVICTOR\nYou would be. You're beautiful,\nsmart, funny. You could run the\nplace if you wanted.\n\nShe smiles.\nSOPHIA\nYou just said I was beautiful. You\nnever tell me I'm beautiful.\n\nVICTOR\nYou know you're beautiful.\n\fHe puts an arm around her and pulls her towards him.\n\nVICTOR\nCome on. Cheer up. Just forget it.\nThat's why we're going to Italy\nright? To forget everything... the\nmagazine, the restaurant.\n\nSOPHIA\nWe're going to Verona to meet the\nsuppliers for your restaurant. How\nare we supposed to forget about it?\n\nVICTOR\nIt's not just gonna be about the\nrestaurant.\n\nSOPHIA\nIt's fine.\n\nVICTOR\nIt's not just gonna be about the\nrestaurant. We're gonna relax, see\nthe sights, shop the stores, it\nwon't just be about the restaurant,\nI promise. It's gonna be great...\n\nSophia wants to believe him but still looks skeptical.\n\nVICTOR\nWe're going to the home of Romeo\nand Juliet. How romantic is that?\n\nSOPHIA\nDidn't exactly work out for them\nthough did it?\n\nEXT. NARROW STREET, VERONA -- DAY\n\nA street that embodies true Verona, hidden away from the well-\nworn tourist routes.

To\ndiscover the true heart and soul of\nany country, first you have to\nindulge in it's smells and tastes.\n\nShe just looks at him. Sometimes he's so full of it.\n\nEXT. ITALIAN COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY\n\nA small Fiat Cinquecento races down a road that cuts through\nthe heart of the countryside.\n\nINT. WINERY -- DAY\n\nVictor tastes a variety of wines with a dashing VITICOLTORE.\nSophia is trying to talk with one of the FIELD HANDS who just\nbrought in a bushel of grapes when she sees Victor by the\nwine barrels waving her over with his camera. She sighs.\n\nINT. IN FRONT OF THOSE WINE BARRELS:\n\nVictor and the Viticoltore pose with their glasses raised in\ntoast for Sophia who prepares to take their picture.\n\nAs her camera flashes we cut to the STILL PHOTO itself.\n\nEXT. EDGE OF FOREST OUTSIDE VERONA -- DAY\n\nThe middle of nowhere. The kind of place where the mob buries\nbodies. Sophia seems acutely aware of this.\n\nSophia and Victor are with a furtive looking MAN dressed in\narmy camo fatigues. There's a SMALL DOG at his side. The man\nis holding a cloth covered basket. He removes the cloth with\na theatrical flourish to reveal a basket full of truffles.\n\nVictor takes one out and smells it. He's awestruck.\n\nVICTOR\nWow.\n\f10.\n\nSophia checks her watch.

He picks up a bottle.\n\nVICTOR\nThis is the one.\n\nSophia is talking with one of the Workers when she sees\nVictor waving to her from across the room with that camera.\n\nFLASH CUT TO:\n\nVictor and his chosen bottle of olive oil posing in front of\nthe ancient olive press with The Old Man.\n\nINT. CURING ROOM -- LATER\n\nVictor and Sophia are in a huge ham curing room. It's\nbasically a giant, poorly-lit shack full of ham.\n\nThere's a row of cured pig heads hanging from hooks. Sophia\nstares at one of them. It stares back. This unsettles her.\n\nA BUTCHER slices thin pieces of prosciutto for them to taste.\nSophia turns down her taste - still staring at the pig head.\nVictor tastes his, chews, then closes his eyes.\n\nVICTOR\nThat's incredible. Can you imagine\nwhen people in The City taste this?\n(MORE)\n\f11.\n\nVICTOR (cont'd)\nI see lines. Wait. Maybe we should\nhave a deli next to the restaurant.\n\nSOPHIA\nThat's actually not a bad idea.\n\nVICTOR\nI know, I know, I'm on fire.\n\nShe has a thought. Then takes out her cell and steps outside.\n\nEXT. MANHATTAN. WHERE:\n\nBobby is hustling down a congested street. He's walking fast\nlike he's late for something. His cell rings.

The\nconstant stream of PEOPLE passing by on their way in and out\nof the courtyard hardly seem to notice her. But Sophia has.\n\nThe Girl looks up from her letter and sees Sophia watching\nher. She looks back through those tears and the crowds. They\nlook at each other long and hard. Sophia smiles. The Girl\nlooks away.\n\nThe Girl's shoulders heave with a great silent sob as she\ntakes a last look at the letter, signs it, puts it an\nenvelope then disappears through the courtyard entrance.\nSophia watches her go. A beat of consideration. Then she\npacks up her laptop, puts money on the table and leaves.\n\nEXT. COURTYARD CASA DI GIULIETTA -- VIA CAPELLO VERONA -- DAY\n\n \n\nSophia enters a strange, eerily quiet scene. This is the\nsupposed courtyard of Juliet Capulet's house. It's become a\nshrine to TEENAGE GIRLS, their conversation is subdued.\nThere's an atmosphere of almost religious reverence.\n\nSophia walks past a group of girls looking up at The Balcony.\nAnother group gazes upon the Statue of Juliet - her left\nbreast polished from years of superstitious touching.\n\nSophia finally comes upon the girl from the street, so\ndesperate yet so full of hope. She's standing before a wall\nthat's covered in envelopes and letters.\n\f14.\n\nSome are wedged between bricks, others are held in place by\nchewing gum, but all are addressed to the same name: \"Juliet\"\n\nSophia watches as the girl finds a place for her letter. She\nleaves it and turns to go. The girl is wiping away tears as\nshe passes Sophia on her way out of the courtyard. Their eyes\nmeet.\n\nSOPHIA\nAre you OK?\n\nThe girl either doesn't understand her or has no interest in\ndiscussing her problems with a stranger. She leaves without a\nword.

Whoa. Wait. What are you\ndoing? You can't do that.\n\nBELLA\nWhy can't I?\n\nSOPHIA\nBecause it's like taking pennies\nout of a wishing well or something,\nthese are people's wishes, you\ncan't just take people's wishes.\n\nBELLA\nBut then how are we supposed to\ngive them answers?\n\nThis throws Sophia.

The kitchen is very busy. In the middle of it all is\nthe head chef, ANGELINA, a round woman in her sixties with a\nno nonsense air about her.

SMALL CHURCH IN TUSCANY -- DAY\n\n \n\nPEOPLE are starting to arrive at a beautiful Medieval Italian\nvillage church. A taxi pulls up and Sophia gets out.\n\nShe looks stunning in a simple pale suit.

She turns to find him smiling at her.\nDressed in a traditional English morning suit, tails,\nwaistcoat, the works. One might even say he looks dashing.\n\nHe approaches. She suddenly seems very nervous.\n\nSOPHIA\nHi!\nCHARLIE\nHi.\nSOPHIA\n(forgets she already said)\nHi...\n\nThey do an awkward hug/kiss on the cheek thing.\n\nSOPHIA\nYou look great.\n\nCHARLIE\nI'm glad you came.

I\njust moved.\n\nA beat as Charlie registers this.\n\f102.\n\nCHARLIE\nIt's fine.

There's our angel.\n\nSophia turns to find Don Alfonso beaming at her. She's\nvisibly taken aback at his appearance. He's so much thinner,\nand what little hair he had left has turned a shade greyer,\nhe walks with a cane now and has a pronounced limp but still\nhe looks like royalty in a fine Italian tuxedo. His grandson,\nAlfonso III, escorts him on his way.\n\nDon Alfonso stops and kisses Sophia on both cheeks.\n\nDON ALFONSO\nThank you for coming.\n\nSOPHIA\nWouldn't miss it for the world.\n\nCHARLIE\nPapa, they need you at the altar.\n\nHe smiles and kisses Sophia's hand before continuing on into\nthe church. Sophia watches him limping on that cane. She\nturns and looks at Charlie. She doesn't even have to ask.\n\nCHARLIE\nHe fell. About two months ago. He\nand Gran were walking in his\nfields. Tripped on vine. Shattered\nhis hip. Had to have it replaced.\n\nSophia watches Don Alfonso smiling and welcoming guests as he\nslowly makes his way down the aisle.\n\nSOPHIA\nThat's terrible.\n\nCHARLIE\nSaved his life actually.\n\nSophia turns back to Charlie who takes a breath before:\n\nCHARLIE\nHe only fell a few feet but the hip\nshattered like a vase.\n\n(MORE)\n\f103.\n\nCHARLIE (cont'd)\n(beat)\nA tumor had hollowed it out.\n\nSophia just stares - speechless.\n\nSOPHIA\nIs he OK...

How awful...\n\nCharlie looks with a smile at Don Alfonso who has finally\nmade it to his place at the altar. He shakes his head.\n\nCHARLIE\nActually they've been\nextraordinary. Really. It's\nhumbling. They're living proof that\nif you find love for even the\nshortest moment, you have to grab\nit with both hands...\n\nCharlie catches himself being sincere. He tries to play it\noff with a wry shrug and smile.\n\nCHARLIE\nTis better to have loved... and all\nthat.\n\nShe manages a smile back.\n\nSOPHIA\nAnd all that.\n\nThey look at each other for a long moment. Sophia looks as if\nshe's about to say something when...\n\nPATRICIA 0O/S\nThere you are.\n\nAt that moment a strikingly beautiful English woman in a gown\nthat matches Charlie's suit approaches.

This is Sophia.\n\nDoing her best to hide her disappointment:\n\nSOPHIA\nHi.\n\nRealization flashes in Patricia's flawless eyes.\n\nPATRICIA\nThe Sophia.\n\nCHARLIE\nThe Sophia.\n\nSophia shrugs and smiles.\n\nPATRICIA\nOh it's so nice to finally meet\nyou. You're kind of a legend around\nhere you know.\n\nA silent beat. Patricia turns to Charlie.\n\nPATRICIA\nI'll see you up there. Don't trip.\n\nCHARLIE\nAs if I'm not nervous enough.\n\nShe kisses his cheek, smiles at Sophia, and heads off down\nthe aisle.\n\nSOPHIA\nShe's beautiful...\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah. Scrubs up well I suppose.\n\nSOPHIA\nAnd is she...\n\nBefore she can ask the question an old Italian limousine\nrolls to a stop at the front steps as Alfonso III walks up.\n\nCHARLIE\nAnd there she is.

The church is idyllic, festooned with\nwhite flowers everywhere. The floral arrangements at the end\nof the pews contain bunches of dark purple grapes.\n\nThe Secretaries of Juliet are together in a pew. They wave to\nSophia as she passes. Bella, ever the romantic, is already\ncrying, handkerchief in hand.\n\nWhen Sophia gets to a seat she looks to the altar where Don\nAlfonso stands waiting for his bride. He turns to look at\nSophia. He smiles sweetly then closes his eyes for a few\nseconds in a silent expression of gratitude. She smiles.\n\nThen the organ begins and a hush falls over the congregation.\n\nCharlie escorts Claire down the aisle. She looks beautiful.\nAll the excitement and radiance of a teenage bride.\n\nAs they pass she sees Sophia and her whole face just lights\nup. She gives her a discreet wave. Sophia smiles and waves\nback but it's all too much and the tears begin to come.\n\nCharlie walks Claire to Don Alfonso. He gives her away.\n\nEXT. SMALL VILLAGE IN TUSCANY -- LATER\n\n \n\nTHE WEDDING PARTY is led through the narrow streets of the\nvillage towards the vineyard by a loud brass band.\n\nVILLAGERS outside bars stand and applaud.

Patricia and Charlie and Alfonso's son and\ngrandson.\n\nAnd lastly the gathering of GUESTS. Sophia is among the first\ncluster just behind the wedding party. Everyone's eyes are on\nThe Bride and Groom except Sophia who's watching Charlie.\n\nThe parade continues. It's a colorful, joyous carnival of an\noccasion.
