WOODS\n\n\n\n               The Rangers plunge into thick woods. Branches slap at them,\n\n               but the sound of gunfire keeps them going. Captain Malcolm\n\n               is still in the lead, flanked by two young men who are\n\n               obviously brothers. The big, handsome one is COLE YOUNGER;\n\n               the skinny one with the lopsided hair is BOB YOUNGER.\n\n\n\n               EXT. WOOD'S EDGE\n\n\n\n               They break through the other side of the woods, emerging\n\n               behind a rickety set of fence-post fortifications. Instantly\n\n               GUNFIRE tears apart the trees around them. The Captain's\n\n               horse goes down, and the Younger brothers dive and roll to\n\n               hide beneath the palisade.\n\n\n\n               The Captain, still alive, has fallen beyond the wooden\n\n               shield. Cole scrambles through the savage rifle fire, grabs\n\n               Captain Malcolm, and hauls him behind the fortification.\n\n\n\n                                     CAPTAIN MALCOLM\n\n                              (bellowing)\n\n                         Fall back into the woods!

The Captain pokes his head up to take\n\n               a look. With him WE SEE\n\n\n\n               EXT. ANOTHER HILLSIDE\n\n\n\n               At the top of which, about a hundred fifty yards off, is a\n\n               three man Gatling crew. Squads of Union soldiers are\n\n               beginning to make their way down the hillside.
