Not yet. He won't\nknow till morning.\n\nTISH\nI've got to tell him.\n\nSHARON\nYou can't get there till morning,\ndaughter.\n\nTISH\n\nI’ve got to tell him now--\n\nSHARON\nTish, you can’t--\n\nTISH\nI've got to....\n\nTish trailing off there, like she’s been dazed, losing the\ntrain of thought as it’s formed. She stares at the entry\nthere, still open, the cement wall rising up to the sidewalk.\n\nSHARON\nHow you feeling?\n\nThe sky opening... or something similar to it — to the sound\nof it — rising from Tish’s chest, hand to her belly.\n\nJoseph jolted, a step toward Tish and then a step back as\nSharon reaches a hand to stop him, all calm.\n\nSharon putting a hand to Tish’s shoulder, eases her the\ncouple steps back to her chair, gently sits her there.\n\nSHARON\n(without looking away)\nCall the ambulance, Joseph.\n\nAnd as her father moves to the phone, his presence long gone\nfrom here, Tish looks to her mother, looks up to her,\nSharon’s image as strong and loving and in spirit as ever.\nSHARON\nDon’t panic, baby. Remember, love\nbrought you here.\nSharon smiles, and...\n\nCUT TO BLACK.\n\f"
