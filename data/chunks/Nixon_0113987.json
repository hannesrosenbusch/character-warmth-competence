The\n                      war on poverty is not a war on crime,\n                      and it is no substitute for a war on\n                      crime.\n                          (pause)\n                      I say to you tonight we must have a\n                      new feeling of responsibility, of self\n                      discipline.

The\n                      average American is just like the\n                      child in the family.  You give him\n                      some responsibility and he is going to\n                      amount to something.

On the other hand, I\n                      am convinced that while legal\n                      segregation is totally wrong, forced\n                      integration of housing or education is\n                      just as wrong!  We simply have to face\n                      the hard fact that the law cannot go\n                      beyond what people are willing to\n                      support.  This was true as far as\n                      Prohibition was concerned.  It is far\n                      more true with regard to education and\n                      housing ... Yet those of us in public\n                      service know -- we can have full\n                      prosperity in peace time ...\n                      Yes, we can cut the defense budget. \n                      We can reduce conventional forces in\n                      Europe.

And yes, we can have a\n                      complete reform of this government. \n                      We can have a new American Revolution.\n\n                                                          CROSSCUT TO:\n\n            DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE - 7.

And as we move closer on\n            Nixon, bleary-eyed, we should feel he has no idea, either,\n            of what he's listening to.  It's just ... noise.  PAT's\n            voice cuts in.
