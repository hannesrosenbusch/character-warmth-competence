MOROCCAN PALACE - DAY. 1\n\nWe fade up on a yellow WALKMAN, and hear Deee-Lite’s “Groove\nis in the Heart”.\n\nIt belongs to A GUARD practicing his dance moves outside a\nremote MOORISH PALACE. ANOTHER GUARD is more chilled. Until:\n\nOn the horizon: a HELICOPTER comes in fast and low, FOUR\nARMED MEN hanging from it, on ropes. They wear gas masks.\n\nThe men shoot both Guards. Then they blow out the windows and\nswing inside, expertly releasing from their ropes.\n\nMoments later, the palace windows BLOW OUT. Fire and smoke\nbillow. Through the comms, we hear, over gunshots:\n\nMALE VOICE (V.0.)\nArea secured... Eyes on the\ntarget... Target secured.\n\nWe move in through a broken window to find...\n\nINT. PALACE STUDY - DAY. 2\n\nThe four operatives, tying A TERRORIST to a chair. The first\noperative performs a swift body check, then removes his gas\nmask. This is JACK LINCOLN, 32, handsome, calm and assured.\n\nAnother man removes his mask. Late 20s, black, good-looking.\nHis code name is MERLIN. He nods respectfully to Jack.\n\nA second follows suit. Early 20s, white, well-groomed, oozing\naristocratic confidence. He’ll come to be known as LANCELOT.\n\nIt takes a nudge from Merlin to prompt the third to remove\nhis mask. This is LEE, 22 - rugged face, army haircut and\nstrong London accent. He looks to Jack, apologetic.\n\nLEE\nSorry, sir.\n\nJack draws a GUN and addresses his captive in perfect Arabic.\n\nJACK\nWe know there's a second attack\nplanned today. I need the location.\nIt‘ll take five shots to take you\nbeyond repa so I suggest you\nanswer quickly.\n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\nStill no response. Jack shoots him swiftly in both legs. The\nTerrorist screams and slumps forward.\n\nJACK (CONT'D)\nThat’s two. You don't want to find\nout where I'll put the third.\n\f2.",

Lee and the Terrorist are killed instantly.\n\nJack, Lancelot and Merlin are blown back by the force, but\nthanks to Lee, they’re alive. They pick themselves up.\n\nJACK\nShit. I missed it. How did I\nfucking miss it?\n\nMERLIN\nTime was of the essence, sir. Could\nhave happened to any one of us.\n\nJACK\nIf it had been one of the trainees,\nit would have been forgivable.\n\nJack glances regretfully at Lee. Then gathers himself.\n\nJACK (CONT'D)\nWhere does this leave us, Merlin?\n\nMERLIN\nLee was the stronger candidate,\nsir. As I believe he just made\nevident.

TAXI/COUNCIL ESTATE - NIGHT. 3\nA bleak, run-down estate. A LONDON TAXI pulls up.\nNo ordinary cab - the interior looks like a gentlemen’s club.\nJack sits with a dignified older gent, ARTHUR, 50s.

But he behaved as much\nlike a Huntsman as any of those\nsmug elitists the others put\nforward for the job. If it weren't\nfor him, I wouldn't be here.\n\nARTHUR\nIs that what’s troubling you,\nGalahad?

CHALET - DAY. 6\nLavish decor, at odds with its occupants -- a hooded MAN tied\n\nto an art deco chair, surrounded by FIVE GOONS.\n\nThe BIGGEST GOON carefully removes the hood, revealing the\nprisoner. This is PROFESSOR ALAN SWANSON, 40s. There's gaffer\ntape over his mouth. The goon starts to gently peel it off.\n\nBIGGEST GOON\nSo sorry, Professor Swanson. Just a\ntiny bit more, I’m trying not to --\n\nThe tape is half off now. The goon tugs gingerly at it.\n\nSWANSON\nFor god's sake, just rip it off!\n\nBIGGEST GOON\nI’m under very strict instructions\nnot to hurt you, but --\n\nThe goon complies, wincing.

Can\nyou get a selection of our finest\nsingle malts, please?\n\nAnother Goon - RED - hustles out.

Stone dead.\n\nLANCELOT? (CONT’D)\nProfessor Swanson. I'm here to take\nyou home.\n\nSWANSON\nThis... isn’t a TV show, is it.\n\nBehind him, Red re-enters carrying a TRAY of various rare\nmalt whiskies. Seeing the carnage, he reaches for his gun --\n\nBut Lancelot spins around, shoots Red dead and lunges just in\ntime to catch the tray in his free hand as Red crumples.\n\nLANCELOT\n1943 Dalmore. It’d be a sin to\nspill any, don't you think?\n\nSuddenly there’s another KNOCK AT THE DOOR. Lancelot -- still\nholding the whiskey in one hand -- readies his weapon.\n\nSuddenly, from another room, a male figure cartwheels in with\nunbelievable speed and agility. He wears a pair of paralympic-\nquality RUNNING BLADES. This is GAZELLE, 30s.\n\nBefore he can react, Gazelle amputates Lancelot’s gun hand\nwith a graceful arc of one - apparently razor sharp - blade.\n\nLancelot drops the whiskey in shock. Gazelle catches it...\n\n-.-And continues to hold it steadily throughout the brief but\nintense fight that ensues. Lancelot gives it his best, but\nhe’s no match for Gazelle and his fearsome samurai running\nblades. The whiskey survives. Lancelot, alas, doesn’t.\n\nSwanson reacts in stunned shock. Gazelle casually strides\naway to answer the front door.\n\nIt’s his boss, VALENTINE. He’s a Mark Zuckerberg type, 20s.\nValentine takes the whiskey, opens it and sniffs it happily.\n\fVALENTINE\nMy kind of welcome.\n\nThen, taking in the carnage, and Swanson’s haunted face, he\nmoves to a nearby counter where he pours two glasses.",
