BACK YARD OF A BEAUTIFUL HOME - LARCHMONT, NY — MORNING\n\n \n\nIt's a gorgeous spring day, and we move in on an impeccably\nlaid out garden. Straight rows of flowers in full bloom,\nmanicured bushes, and a trellis with climbing vines.\n\nBECCA CORBETT, attractive, 30's, walks into frame dragging a\nheavy bag of potting soil. She pulls the soil bag over to a\nsection of the garden where she had been digging, and cuts\nthe bag open.\n\nBecca dumps the soil onto the ground where she is planting\nflowers. Behind her, we see part of her fine house and\nacross the street, a shimmering stretch of water.\n\nBecca is on her knees now mixing potting soil with earth.\nShe starts to plant a straight line of young plants as a\nborder to her flower-bed.\n\nShe picks up the hose from beside the free-standing garage.\nNear her we notice an empty doghouse\n\nA little later, Becca stands with a hose, watering the\ngarden. She admires her day's work.\n\nEND OF OPENING SEQUENCE\n\nWOMAN'S VOICE (0.C.)\nBecca?\n\nBecca turns to see her neighbor PEG, middle-aged, peeking\nfrom behind the gate leading to the next property. She comes\ninto the garden.

Becca watches for a moment, then\nturns off the water in the sink, dries her hands, and turns\nthe blinds so no one can see inside.\n\nHowie, home from work, comes in and grabs a beer.\n\nHOWIE\nMmmm. Smells good in there.\n\nBECCA\nIf Peg asks, we went out tonight.\n\nHOWIE\nWhere'd we go?\n\nBECCA\nWe saw the Stoppard play.\n\nHOWIE\nReally?\n\fBECCA\nUh-huh.\n\nHOWIE\nDid we enjoy it?\n\nBECCA\nVery much.\n\nBecca is at the stove now melting some butter in a pan.\n\nBECCA\nShe asked us to dinner again.\n\nHOWIE\nShe's just being nice.\n\nBECCA\nYou're more than welcome to go over\nthere.\n\nHOWIE\n\nAnd abandon your risotto?\n(wraps arms around her)\n\nBECCA\nCareful, Howie.

He slows to a stop at the curb. He\nputs the car into park.\n\nHe looks up at the house, and takes a deep breath. He's\nterrified. He doesn't move. He just sits in his car.\n\nEXT. GABBY'S HOUSE\n\nFinally, he can't bear it anymore. He opens the car door,\nand gets out. He smooths his shirt, and heads up the walk-\nway toward Gabby's front door. It's just a few yards, but\nthe walk may as well be a hundred miles.\n\nThe door opens, and Gabby steps outside. She looks pretty.\n\nGABBY\nDid you find the house okay?\n\nHowie doesn't respond. He doesn't even move.\n\nGABBY\nHowie?\n\nIs he going to go through with this?\nINT. BECCA'S CAR - INTERCUT\n\nShe pulls up Jason's block, and can't help smiling. She's\ngrown to enjoy these encounters with him.\n\nBut as she gets closer, her smile fades. She's really not\nexpecting to see the scene in front of her.\n\nEXT. TREE-LINED STREET - OUTSIDE JASON'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\n\nBecca stops the car a safe distance away, unnoticed by\nanyone. There's a limo parked at the bottom of the driveway.\nBecca watches as Jason, in a tuxedo, very self-consciously\npins a corsage to a SKINNY GIRL in a prom dress.\n\f86.\n\nJASON'S MOTHER, giddy with pride, takes picture after\npicture. JASON'S BUDDY and his BUDDY'S DATE heckle them from\ninside the car.\n\nWhen it's time to go, Jason and his date, move to squeeze in\nthe back seat.

A lot. She clutches the\nsteering wheel and pretty much loses it.\n\nEXT. BECCA'S FRONT LAWN - DAY - FLASHBACK (SLO-MO)\n\nJason, at the wheel of his car, terror in his eyes, turns to\nsee Becca standing outside of her house, trembling, not\ncomprehending at all what she sees. They lock eyes.\n\nThough Becca has just seen the body of Danny, we never do.\nWe only see Becca and Jason in this moment. And then...\n\nINT. LIMO — SIMULTANEOUS (SLO-MO\n\nStill laughing, Jason turns for just a moment and sees\nBecca's car as they roll by. Becca is hysterical but silent\nbehind the glass of her windows.

Gabby is waiting. She tries\nto smile. Howie takes a step back.\n\f87.\n\nHOWIE\n(barely a whisper)\nI'm sorry.\n\nHowie turns, and heads for the car. He gets back in. Gabby\nwatches as he starts the car and pulls away.\n\nWhen he's gone, her shoulders drop in defeat. She slips\ninside, and gently closes the door behind her.\n\nINT. HOWIE'S CAR — SPEEDING HOME - MOMENTS LATER\n\n \n\nHowie is suddenly in a big hurry to get home.

He peers out the kitchen window into the\nbackyard. Taz is asleep in the dog house.\n\nHe moves to the basement door, and listens. Nothing.

But there's nothing.\nOther than the stripped bed, the room is completely empty.\n\nAnd slowly, we see Howie’s determination drain out of his\n\nbody. He’s too late. Becca isn’t here. And he’s convinced\nshe’s actually left him.\n\nSpent, Howie sits on the bed, staring off into space. Then\nhe quietly takes off his shoes, and lies back on the bed.\nBACK TO BECCA IN HER CAR - STILL ACROSS FROM JASON’S HOUSE\n\nThe prom car is gone. Becca is alone now. The street is\nempty again.\nShe finally lets go of the steering wheel. Her crying is\n\npretty much over. But she doesn't start the car. She just\nsits there.\n\nINT.

Becca smiles, and picks up the comic book.\n\nBECCA\nWell, I liked this so much. It’s\nbeautiful.\n\nJASON\nThanks.\n\nBECCA\nIt reminded me of Orpheus and\nEurydice. Do you know that myth?\n\nJASON\nNot really.\n\nBECCA\nEurydice dies, and Orpheus misses\nher so much, that he travels to\nHades to retrieve her, but in the\nend it doesn't work out.\n\f90.\n\nJASON\nI should read it.\n\nBecca flips through the book. Jason undoes his bow-tie.\n\nBECCA\nSo, is the scientist your dad?\n(off his blank look)\nThe scientist the boy is looking\nfor, is that your dad?\n\nJASON\n(beat)\nNo.\n\nBECCA\nI mean, is it based on him?\n\nJASON\nNo. My dad was an English teacher.\n\nBECCA\nOh. Okay. I was curious about\nthat part.\n\nJASON\n\nIt's just a story.\n\nBECCA\nNo, I know. I was just...\n\nJASON\nReading into it?\n\nBECCA\nYeah.\n\nThey sit there. A jogger runs by in silence.\n\nBECCA\nDo you think they're real?\n\nJASON\nParallel universes?\n\nJASON\nI think it’s basic science. If\nspace is infinite, then everything\nis possible.\n\f91.\n\nShe smiles a little.

DANNY'S ROOM — MORNING\n\nHowie fell asleep on Danny's bed last night. He wakes up,\nsquinting at the sun coming in from the windows.\n\nWe hear the clink of mugs being taken from a cabinet, and\ncoffee being made. Morning sounds.\n\f92.\n\nIt's so strikingly normal that Howie wonders for a moment if\nhe isn’t imagining it. And when he realizes he isn’t, a wave\nof relief washes over him.\n\nINT. KITCHEN — MOMENTS LATER\n\nBecca is at the table, drinking her coffee, nibbling on a\npiece of pastry.\n\nHowie comes in, still sleepy, and takes in the scene. He\ngets a mug, and pours himself some coffee.\n\nHowie gets a plate, and cuts himself a piece. Then moves to\nthe table. They drink their coffee. After a while...\n\nHOWIE\nI thought maybe you had left.\n\nShe sees the fear in his eyes, and she feels badly for him.\n\nBECCA\nNo. I didn't leave.\n\nHowie hides his relief by reaching for the morning paper, and\nleafing through its contents.\n\nBECCA\nSo I was thinking we should invite\nRick and Debbie over for a cookout.\n\nHowie looks up at her, totally perplexed.\n\nBECCA\nShe's never gonna call. She thinks\nI hate her. I might as well just\nlet her off the hook.\n\nHOWIE\nSo a cookout then.\n\nBECCA\nIt'll be good to see the kids. We\nshould get something for Emily\nthough.

BECCA AND HOWIE'S BACK YARD - A FEW WEEKS LATER - DAY\n\n \n\nA bright day. Howie is at the grill. Nat is blabbing away\nto him. Becca is chatting with her neighbors (Peg and Pete.)\n\nRick and Debbie come through the back gate with EMILY, 4 and\nROBBIE, 7. Becca gets up and welcomes them.\n\nHOWIE (V.O.)\nAnd they'll come over, and we'll\nhave a couple other people so it's\nnot too awkward for anyone.\n\nDebbie is still rather sheepish and apologetic when greeting\nBecca.
