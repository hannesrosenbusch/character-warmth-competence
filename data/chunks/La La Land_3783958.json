The\n\n      seats around the band are almost all occupied. Young fans,\n\n      older couples, passersby trickling in from outside.

Wavering, unsure what to do, she follows\n\n      him as he manages to find two empty seats close to the\n\n      bandstand...\n\n\n\n      The combo finishes. Hearty applause. A young PIANIST rises\n\n      from the keys, waves \"thanks\".\n\n\n\n      And -- just then -- Sebastian appears.

Sebastian smiles, looks at them --\n\n\n\n      -- and sees Mia.\n\n\n\n      Shock. The two LOCK EYES -- and you can tell it's the first\n\n      time they've seen each other in years.\n\n\n\n      A prolonged silence. Sebastian is speechless.\n\n\n\n      Then -- forcing himself to keep on a face --\n\n\n\n                             SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)\n\n                Welcome to Seb's.\n\n\n\n      More applause. Sebastian sits at the piano. Looks at the keys.\n\n\n\n      He seems uncertain -- perhaps unsure what to play. He looks at\n\n      Mia. Takes the sight in. Beat. Then looks at his fellow\n\n      musicians. Murmurs to them. Then turns back to the keys --\n\n\n\n      -- and finally starts playing.\n\n                                 Revision                         82.\n\n\n\n\n\n      A quieter tune, just piano, soft and tender and melancholy. A\n\n      melody we -- and Mia -- instantly recognize...\n\n\n\n      It's Mia and Sebastian's song.\n\n\n\n      Mia looks at Sebastian.
