ED’S DRIVE-IN - KITCHEN —- DAY\n\nThe kitchen of a drive-in restaurant outside St. Louis. It’s\n1954. Traveling salesman RAY KROC (52) stands before a sample\nMIXING MACHINE, making his pitch to the OWNER.\n\nRAY KROC\n\nNow, I know what you’re thinking:\n“What the heck do I need a five-\nspindle for? I barely sell enough\nshakes to justify my single\nspindle.” Right? Wrong.\n\n(BEAT)\nMr. Paulsen, are you familiar with\nthe notion of the chicken and the\negg? I mention it because I believe\nit’s applicable here: Do you not\nneed a Multimixer because you're\nnot selling enough milk shakes? Or\nare you not selling enough milk\nshakes because you don’t have a\nMultimixer? I firmly believe it’s\nthe latter. You see, your\ncustomers, they know that if they\norder a shake from your\nestablishment, it’s going to be a\nterrific wait. They’ve ordered one\nbefore, and by golly they’re not\ngonna make that mistake again. But\nif you had, say, a Prince Castle-\nbrand five-spindle Multimixer with\npatented direct-drive electric\nmotor, you could greatly increase\nyour ability to produce delicious,\nfrosty milk shakes fast. And before\nlong, mark my words, dollars to\ndonuts, you'd be selling more of\nthose suckers than you can shake a\nstick at. Increase supply, demand\nwill follow. Chicken and the egg.\nYou follow my logic? Of course you\ndo. You’re a bright, forward-\nthinking fella who knows a good\nidea when he hears it.\n\n(BEAT)\nSo whaddaya say?\n\nON THE OWNER-- pondering thoughtfully.\n\nOWNER\nNah.\n(BEAT)\nThanks anyway.\n\fEXT.

He turns on the car, pulls\ninto a customer spot in front of Ed’s Drive-In.\n\nHe looks at the MENU BOARD, taking in the vast, seemingly\nrandom assortment of items: BBQ beef sandwiches, hot tamales,\npeanut butter and jelly sandwiches, chili dogs, etc.\n\nINT.

The tray of Cokes goes flying\ninto the car, SPILLING ALL OVER KROC’S LAP. Several glasses\nand plates fall on the ground, SHATTERING.\n\nCarhop Girl spins around, sees a GUY behind her cracking up.\nHe just pinched her butt.\n\fCARHOP\nDennis!\n(re: Kroc, soaked)\nLook what you made me do!\n\nDENNIS\nSorry, gramps.\n\nDennis scampers off toward his pack of laughing friends. The\ncarhop goes chasing after him, mad but not actually mad.\n\nON KROC-- looking down at the pool of bubbly brown liquid in\nhis lap.
