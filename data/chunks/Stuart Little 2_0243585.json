We see birds eating\noff the ground, out of trash cans, even swooping down to\nsteal a piece of donut out of the hand of a sleepy citizen\njust leaving his house.\nThe last bird we see flies towards the house of the Little\nfamily.\nINT.

It is STUART.\n\n(For those who haven't read the book or seen the movie,\nStuart is a mouse.)\n\nStuart is sleepy. He staggers around almost blindly. He\nalmost steps off the edge of his bunk. This wakes him\nmore completely. He rubs his eyes and stretches and\nsmiles. Grabbing hold of a miniature fireman's pole built\nout of tinker toys, slides down to the lower bunk and\ncrosses over to George's sleeping head.\n\nSTUART\nGeorge, wake up.\n\nGeorge is a hard wake-up.\nStuart stands on George's chest and jumps up and down.\n\nSTUART\nGeorge.\n\nGEORGE\nIt's Saturday.\n\nSTUART\nI know.
