Epstein\nHoward Koch\n\nBased on the play EVERYBODY GOES TO RICK'S\n\nby Murray Burnett, Joan Alison\n\nWhen production began the script was only half completed,\nnear the end of production the script was literally being\nwritten the night before, and in the final days of filming,\nthe dialogue for some scenes was written while shooting was\nactually in progress and then rushed to the set. Dialogue\nfor the final seconds of the film was even added well after\nproduction had been completed.\n\nIt is therefore accurate to say that no complete production\nscript for Casablanca exists. The script that follows is\ntherefore a synthesis of extant versions of the shooting\nscript, the continuity script, and a close analysis of the\nfinished film.\n\fFADE IN:\n\nINSERT - A revolving globe. When it stops revolving it turns\nbriefly into a contour map of Europe, then into a flat map.\n\nSuperimposed over this map are scenes of refugees fleeing from\nall sections of Europe by foot, wagon, auto, and boat, and all\nconverging upon one point on the tip of Africa -- Casablanca.\n\nArrows on the map illustrate the routes taken as the voice of a\nNARRATOR describes the migration.\n\nNARRATOR (V.O.)\nWith the coming of the Second World\nWar, many eyes in imprisoned Europe\nturned hopefully, or desperately,\ntoward the freedom of the Americas.\nLisbon became the great embarkation\npoint. But not everybody could get\nto Lisbon directly, and so, a tortuous,\nroundabout refugee trail sprang up.\nParis to Marseilles, across the\nMediterranean to Oran, then by train,\nor auto, or foot, across the rim of\nAfrica to Casablanca in French Morocco.\nHere, the fortunate ones, through money,\nor influence, or luck, might obtain\nexit visas and scurry to Lisbon, and\nfrom Lisbon to the New World. But\nthe others wait in Casablanca -- and\nwait -- and wait -- and wait.\n\nThe narrator's voice fade away...\nCUT TO:\nEXT.",

Rick returns Renault's\ngaze with expressionless eyes.\n\nRENAULT\nRound up the usual suspects.\n\nGENDARME\nOui, mon Capitaine.\n\nThe gendarmes take Strasser's body away and then drive off.\n\nRenault walks inside the hangar, picks up a bottle of Vichy\nwater, and opens it.\n\nRENAULT\n\f126.\n\nWell, Rick, you're not only a\nsentimentalist, but you've become\n\na patriot.\n\nRICK\nMaybe, but it seemed like a good time\nto start.\n\nRENAULT\n\nI think perhaps you're right.\n\nAs he pours the water into a glass, Renault sees the Vichy\nlabel and quickly DROPS the bottle into a trash basket which\nhe then KICKS over.\n\nHe walks over and stands beside Rick. They both watch the\nplane take off, maintaining their gaze until it disappears\ninto the clouds.\n\nRick and Louis slowly walk away from the hangar toward the\nrunway.\n\nRENAULT\nIt might be a good idea for you\nto disappear from Casablanca for\na while. There's a Free French\ngarrison over at Brazzaville.\nI could be induced to arrange a\npassage.\n\nRICK\nMy letter of transit? I could use\na trip. But it doesn't make any\ndifference about our bet.
