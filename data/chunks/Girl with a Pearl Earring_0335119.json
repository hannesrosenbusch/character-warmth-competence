This is an expected event.\n\nThere is a silent understanding between them. GRIET places his\nbest black jacket on the bed, guides his hand with her spread\n\nfingers.\n\nAfter a moment he stops her, instead he searches with fumbling\nfingers on a shelf by the bed.

The youngest(LISBETH), clutching a rag\ndoll, pulls at MAERTGE'S sleeve impatiently.\n\nAfter a moment the next oldest, CORNELIA, a thin, quick child\nwith bright red hair snatches them and blows a stream of\nbubbles.

GRIET arranges her few possessions\nneatly: the prayer book and comb, her best lace collar, chemises\nand aprons, her father’s tile. Wearily she kneels to pray. Her\nhands are already red and raw from all the work. She is about to\ntake off her cap when she stops, uneasy. She looks around the\ndark room, shadows flickering in the candlelight. Suddenly she\nsees a face, ghostly white.\n\nIt is a Pleta; Mary holding the dead body of Christ, the\nVirgin's face hollow-eyed with grief, an arm raised in wild\ndespair.\n\nGRIET looks at it uneasily.
