INDUSTRIAL KITCHEN 117\n\nIt’s all clean steel surfaces, and whites; we’re in a very\nhigh end industrial kitchen. Mike, on his knees, has a bag\npulled off his head, and finds himself facing an\n\nINTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL, impeccably dressed, looking like one\nof Ocean's Eleven. Goons flank him on all sides. One of\nthem approaches the boss.\n\nGOON\nAll he had on him was this.\n\nThe goon shows the International Criminal a napkin with a\npicture of Rocket Monkey drawn on it that says “FUCK YOU.”\n\nINTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL\nThis is it? This is him? How far\nhas the CIA fallen, that they send\none man. Who are you? Are you\nJames Bond? Did they really think\nthey could sneak up on ME? I am\nRobertito Lazaniafrespasda. And\nwhat do they send? A TOURIST.\n\f108.\n\nThe goons laugh.",
  "73": "END OF PREVIOUSLY ANNOTATED SECTION:\nA TOURIST. 108. The goons laugh. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\n Mike looks around the room; knives on the\ncounter, skewers in a cupboard, pans hanging, sausages\nhanging, open flame on the grills, a tray of dirty forks\nknives and spoons, a pile of plates.\n\nINTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL (CONT’D)\nOne man. One UNARMED man.\n\nMike laughs to himself weirdly.\n\nINTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL (CONT’D)\nSomething funny?\n\nMIKE\nI’m sorry.\n(beat)\nI’m just so fucking high right now.\n\nThe criminal reacts: “What?” And then MIKE SUDDENLY LUNGES\nFORWARD-—\n\nSLAM TO BLACK.\n\nCUE: “EXTREME\nWAYS” BY MOBY\n\nTHE END.\n\nAFTER CREDITS...\n\nINT. THE MAURY POVITCH SHOW 118\n\nMAURY Povitch is interviewing Rose, who’s seated next to a\nbig fat chinese woman who looks mad. Up on a big screen\nthere’s an image of a half-chinese baby.\n\nMAURY\nWell, the test results are in.\nRose, do you still deny you are the\nfather?\n\nROSE\nThat's right, it is unfeasible that\nthat baby could be mine.\n\nMAURY\nUnfeasible, really?\n\f109.\n\nROSE\nYes sir. Yes sir Maury, I was\ninvolved in an incident, a violent\nincident ten months ago,\nclandestine and sworn to secrecy,\nbut it has left me unfertile.\n\nMAURY\nUnfertile?\n\nROSE\nYes sir unfertile and barren.\n\nMAURY\nOkay.
