LARRABEE ESTATE - EVENING\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nOnce upon a time, on the North Shore of Long Island,\nsome 30 miles from New York, there lived a small girl on\na large estate. The estate was very large indeed and had\nmany servants. There were gardeners to take care of the\ngardens and a tree surgeon on a retainer. There was a\nboatman to put the boats in the water in the spring and\nscrape their bottoms in the winter. There were specialists\nto take care of the grounds, the outdoor tennis court and\nthe indoor tennis court, the outdoor swimming pool and the\nindoor swimming pool. And aman of no particular title\ntook care of a small pool in the garden for a goldfish\n\nnamed George.\n\nAlso on the estate there was a chauffeur by the name\nof Fairchild, who had been imported from England years\nago, together with a new Rolls-Royce. Fairchild was a\nfine chauffeur of considerable polish, like the eight\ncars in his care. And he had a daughter by the name of\n\n... Sabrina.\n\nIt was the eve of the annual six-meter-yacht races\nand, as had been traditional on Long Island for the past\n30 years, the Larrabees were giving a party.

Maude and Oliver Larrabee were married in 1906\nand among their many wedding presents was a town house\n\nin New York and this estate for weekends.\n\nThe town house has since been converted into Saks Fifth\nAvenue. Linus Larrabee, the elder son, graduated from\nYale, where his classmates voted him the man most likely\nto leave his alma mater 50 million dollars. His brother,\nDavid, went through several of the best Eastern colleges\nfor short periods of time, and through several marriages\nfor even shorter periods of time. He is now a successful\nsix-goal polo player and is listed on Linus's tax return\nas a 600-dollar deduction.",
