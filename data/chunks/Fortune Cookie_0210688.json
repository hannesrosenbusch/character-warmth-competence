The camera retreats to reveal a dining room full\nof similarly accoutred tables and satisfied restaurant\nmanager HUE LING.\n\nHUE returns through the kitchen doors and picks up a tray of\npre-cut fortune cookie dough.

BETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 96\n\nBETH and AMANDA are dancing around the living room to \"Take A\nChance On Me.\" The phone rings. Beth turns the music way\ndown. Amanda continues to dance behind Beth as she speaks on\nthe phone.\n\nBETH\nHello.\nTRENT\nUh, hi, Beth. This is Trent.\nBETH\nWhat's up?\nTRENT\n\nListen, I wanted to call and tell you\nthat I ..I don't know.. that I think you're\nswell.\n\nBETH\nSwell?\n\nTRENT\nAnd smart and funny and cynical. Mainly\nswell.\n\nBETH\nUh, thanks.\n\nTRENT\nSo what are you doing tomorrow?\n\nBETH\n(unsure)\nStudying.\n\nAMANDA has danced back over to the stereo and turned it up\njust in time for a repeat of the \"Take a chance, Take a\nchance\" chorus.\n\nBETH (CONT. )\n(CONT'D)\nBut, I'll probably be able to free up\nsome time...\nTRENT\n\nThat's great.\n\n(CONTINUED )\n\fFortune Cookie - 111.\n\n96 CONTINUED:\n\nBETH\nif...\n\nTRENT\nUh huh.",
  "71": "END OF PREVIOUSLY ANNOTATED SECTION:\n(CONTINUED )\n\fFortune Cookie - 111. 96 CONTINUED:\n\nBETH\nif... TRENT\nUh huh. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\nBETH\nwif you tell me what you're favorite\nmovie is.\n\nTRENT\n\n(long beat)\nGhandi.\n\nBETH\nGhandi?\n\nTRENT\nYou asked.\n\nBETH\n\nYou know what? That's so uncool, I think\nI believe you.\n\n97 EXT. DEAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nCAROLYN knocks on DEAN'S door. DEAN answers. The two\nthere awkwardly for a moment.\n\nCAROLYN\nMarry me.\n\nDEAN\nNo.\n\nCAROLYN\n\nIs that soup bowl of mine still here.\n\nDEAN\nYou don't get to ask that question. It's\nmine. I bought a ring and everything.\n\nDEAN produces the ring.\n\nCAROLYN\nHave I spoiled the drama?\n\nDEAN\nI'm still shaking. Carolyn, the backwards\nway I asked earlier--I deserved a no.\n\nCAROLYN\nTry again.\n\n96\n\n97\n\nstand\n\n(CONTINUED )\n\f97\n\n98\n\nFortune Cookie - 112.\nCONTINUED: 97\n\nDEAN\nMarry me.\n\nCAROLYN\nI can't think of a single reason not to.\n\nThe two kiss joyfully.\nINT. THE EMPIRE - NIGHT 98\nWe return to GARRETT'S interview scene.\n\nGARRETT\n\nCall me jaded, but at least I know what\nmy job is here. I'm not in the fortune\nbusiness. I'm just supposed to provide a\nconversation piece for our customers.\nNot everybody gets it. I know this guy\nwho swears by fortune cookies, because he\ngot four out of six numbers on the\nlottery off a fortune cookie and won a\nfew hundred bucks. If it were me, I'd\nwonder why the cookie didn't give me the\nother two digits. If anything I write\never does come true, it's because it's\nself-fulfilling. People believe what they\nwant to believe. And most people want to\nbelieve in happy endings.\n\n(Long, long pause)\nNot me. I like it when endings are\nunapologetically grim. The hero gets\ncommitted to an asylum and his lover has\nto marry a drug lord to pay the bills.\nNow that's a finale.\n\nFADE TO BLACK.\n\f"
