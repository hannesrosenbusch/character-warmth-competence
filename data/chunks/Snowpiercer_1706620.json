She\nshoves the stick inside the horizontal crack where Andy\nappeared to scoop out a CAUCASIAN GIRL (6).\n\nThe Girl is still asleep, rubbing her eyes, as she\nautomatically walks toward the Core.\n\nAlarms blare louder as the Engine Core protrudes like a\npiston to reveal a LATINO GIRL (6) inside who walks out.

With one arm gone, he resembles Gilliam or\nperhaps a saint.\n\nNamgoong and Curtis face each other to embrace Yona who holds\nTim in her arms.
