It's only been a\nweek.\" \"Are you still in that tub?\" \"The dector says\nI'm supposed to soak.” “Have you gotten out to check\nher?\" “Yes, she's fine. How was your evening?\"\n“Everybody was having fun tonight and all I got te do\nwas worry about the baby.\" Her footsteps approach;\n\nher conversation continues. We hear one more exchange\nbetween husband and wife. “Aurora, you've just got to\nstop imagining that something terrible is happenings to\nher all the time.\" \"I know, I know.\" The door at\nscreen right opens and we now can recognize from the\nlight flowing in from the hall that we are in a baby's\nroom--the clown's face a small nicht light. The\n\ninfant is in a hand worked, excellent and therefore\nmemorable crib. AURORA'S back is to the camera--her\nrear end a larse one, perhaps tempting to some--ané\n\nher back-lit outline is round and cushy. She tosses\n\neft one more comment to her husband. \"She is just\n\nabout a week old. How endless is the fascination\nsupposed to be?\" And now she turns towards the room\n\nand is facing the camera still illuminated from behind--\nthe mother's form we may all remember framed in the\ndoorways of our rooms as we lay helpless and needing.\nAURORA stands still for a beat and then, in a tone\nfearful but firm, says her first on screen words.\n\nAURORA\nRudyard, she's not breathing.",
