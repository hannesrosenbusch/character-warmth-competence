What?\n\n                         JOHNSON\n          Sure.

Passengers walk through\n          customs right back home exposing\n          families, cabbies, friends.  Over\n          night thousands are exposed.  Then\n          the outbreak.  Slate wiper...\n\nSilence.  The sounds of nature abound.  Jaxx is riveted.\n\n                         JOHNSON\n                  (inevitable)\n          Pretty soon us two-legged dinosaurs\n          are history.\n\n                         JAXX\n          Mother nature's revenge...

Why not go back\n          to Africa and find the viruses\n          before they find us, huh?\n\n                         JOHNSON\n          I never should have left.\n\n                         JAXX\n          You better teach me to fish quick,\n          because that's where you're going.\n\nJaxx jumps up, brushing herself off.",

To date the origin or reservoir of the Ebola virus is\n    still unknown; there is still no vaccine for Ebola and\n    no proven cure.\n\n2.  The CDC levied fines against Synergy and three other\n    primate companies and banned the shipment of monkeys\n    into the United States for 18 months.\n\n3.  No virus was found at the JFK animal unit where the\n    monkeys entered the U.S.  The Philippine exporter\n    would not allow a CDC/Army Team to inspect their\n    animal quarantine unit.\n\n4.  Monkeys with the Ebola virus were reported in primate\n    quarantine units in Texas and Pennsylvania during the\n    Reston outbreak.\n\n5.  Nancy and Gerry Jaxx are both acting Colonels of\n    Veterinary Medicine at USAMRIID and are actively\n    involved in vaccine and viral research... including\n    Ebola.\n\n6.  Peter Jahrling is alive and well and Head of Virology\n    at USAMRIID.  He continues his research on synthetic\n    antibodies and is currently in South America isolating\n    a new virus.\n\n7.
