But then we\n \n              MOVE slowly across the bed toward the window, passing the\n              nightlight plugged into the wall panel, right up to the\n              window and\n \n              THROUGH IT\n \n              into the dark night. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\n We get a nice bird's eye view of the\n              street.\n \n              Pools of black shadow lie everywhere. The houses along the\n              street are all dark grey shapes set against a starless sky.\n              Each house appears very middle-class suburban.\n \n              All is quiet. Still.\n \n              Across the street from Lynn's, SOMETHING MOVES FROM UNDER THE\n              SHADOW OF A TREE.\n \n              Still hidden in the darkness under the leaves, it's\n              impossible to tell what it is. Then THE CLOWN moves into the\n              light and we can see he's got some sort of bag in his hand.\n              The streetlight above catches him in total silhouette, so\n              it's impossible to tell much about him.\n\n              And yet, there's something definitely sinister about him. Is\n              it the peculiar sight of a clown standing in a deserted\n              street in the dead of night? Or something else...?\n \n              The clown scans the houses across the street and his gaze\n              stops at the house two doors up from Lynn.\n \n              He turns to look directly at Lynn's house, and makes a\n              shrugging motion, very much like, \"What can I do? My hands\n              are tied.\"\n \n              He moves across the street, taking a new grip on whatever's\n              in the bag, and the bag falls into the street.\n \n              He holds a giant axe. Even in the dim light, the silver axe-\n              blade gleams like mercury.\n \n              Silently, the house awaits his entrance. Taking his time, he\n              moves toward the door.\n \n              EXT. HOUSE - DAY\n \n              Lynn rushes out of her house, clearly late for something. She\n              stops in confusion as she sees five cop cars and an ambulance\n              in front of the house two doors down.\n \n              A good bunch of the neighbors--moms and kids--stand about in\n              groups, pointing and asking questions. Lynn goes over to a\n              neighbor, GALE, a chubby motherly type who's shaking her head\n              without realizing it.\n \n                                  LYNN\n                        Excuse me...I'm house-sitting for\n                        Margaret.

WOODS - DAY\n \n              Tuck pulls his cycle into a cul-de-sac off of the main road.\n              A high fence runs the entire length of the road, but there's\n              a hole in it where it curves for the cul-de-sac.\n\n              He helps Lynn off and stacks the helmets on the back.\n \n                                  TUCK\n                        Come on.\n \n              He leads her to the hole and helps her climb through.\n \n              Once through, they're in a wooded area. Lots of trees and ivy\n              and overgrowth.\n \n              Tuck takes her hand and leads her.\n \n              EXT. LAND OF MYTH\n \n              They emerge from the woods into a huge clear area. Everywhere\n              you look is the remnants of what used to be a theme park\n              devoted to fairy tales.\n \n              A plastic statue of Jack(no sign of Jill) lies on the ground\n              covered by weeds. A tall beanstalk like the one Jack might\n              have climbed(had his been made of metal) creeps up to the sky\n              but doesn't go as far as it used to. A castle that was once\n              pristine is falling to ruin and ivy threatens to pull down\n              its every wall.\n \n                                  LYNN\n                        Where are we?\n \n                                  TUCK\n                        It was called The Land Of Myth.",

I\n                        was twelve. Sitting on the bench\n                        in the waiting area. Doctors\n                        rushing around...hurt, sick people\n                        everywhere. That awful smell...\n \n              He's rambling, staring at the blade, mesmerized by his\n              reflection maybe, but now he's closer to the front door than\n              Lynn is.\n\n                                  PHILLIP\n                        And what I keep remembering--it\n                        haunts me in my sleep--was those\n                        policemen who walked by.\n                               (mimics one)\n                        \"The little girl, she distracted\n                        him. Drove right into them.\"\n \n              Then his gaze locks on her. She doesn't know what he's\n              talking about.\n \n                                  PHILLIP\n                        I knew Bert, you know. He treated\n                        me for years. That's how I met\n                        Doug--the clown. He was so nuts\n                        that it didn't take much to\n                        convince him that killing you\n                        would make him all better. Of\n                        course, he was a loaded gun. He\n                        came after me tonight, but...I\n                        straightened him out.\n \n              His expression goes grim. Lynn can't absorb it, doesn't\n              understand any of it.\n \n                                  PHILLIP\n                        Don't worry, you can ask your dad\n                        what I'm talking about when you\n                        visit him in hell.\n \n              He raises the blade and rushes at her. She stumbles back,\n              shoving a tall lamp in his way. He trips over it and falls,\n              catching himself at the last second. He regains a measure of\n              his dignity, brushing at his pants as he stands.\n \n              It might be funny if it weren't for the huge knife in his\n              hand.",
