An attractive\nclerk, CHLOE (19), closes up, flipping the ‘Open’ sign to\n‘Closed’.\n\nOUTSIDE, the sound of a MAN, half-humming, half -singing,\ncan be heard getting closer. A barely recognizable\nversion of “Climb Every Mountain” from “The Sound of\nMusic.”\n\nMAN (0.S.)\n...ford every stream, follow every\nrainbow, till you find your dream.\n\nChloe wipes down the display cases with windex. The\nsinging abruptly stops.\n\nKNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK! Startled, Chloe looks over to see\nsomeone banging on the glass. A MAN in his twenties\nwearing a wrinkled suit. This is GUS.\n\nCHLOE\nSorry we’re closed.\nGUS\nWait, it’s my daughter’s birthday. I\n\nneed a gift.\n\nChloe ignores him, keeps cleaning.
