As the song crescendos at \n               the first chorus, SUNLIGHT flares over the lunar horizon and \n               a crescent sliver of THE MOON is illuminated - huge, filling \n               the screen from top to bottom. We're in space, circling around \n               from the dark side until a HUGE FULL MOON fills the screen \n               with whiteness - TITLES continue as we pull back from the \n               moon, into the earth's atmosphere, through CLOUDS, until we \n               reveal\n\n               PARIS AT NIGHT\n\n               We come to rest on an ancient, vaguely wolf-like GARGOYLE \n               high atop a gothic cathedral in the Latin Quarter - a maze \n               of narrow, twisting streets - desolate at this late hour. \n               Clouds move over the moon. End TITLES. The song fades. A \n               THUNDER CRACK. Rain drops spatter on the church's metal roof. \n               Water trickles out of the gargoyle's mouth.

They \n               open an umbrella and stand underneath it, smooching and \n               giggling. We follow the STREAM OF WATER from their umbrella \n               to the street, where it swirls into drain holes in the MANHOLE \n               COVER that they're standing on. Suddenly...\n\n               CLANG!! The manhole cover pushes up under their feet. He \n               flinches - bites down on her lip, drawing blood. She yelps.\n\n               CLANG!!

A POODLE \n               yaps at him. The dog is in the open doorway of the Concierge's \n               apartment, which opens into the courtyard.

The \n               pentagram glows and seems to grow out of the wall...\n\n               The hallucinatory flash is over as fast as it began. Panting, \n               stunned, Andy shakes it off.

He feels around the gravel, finds his GLASSES - they're \n               shattered. He scowls. He stands up and walks ahead, feeling \n               his way along the slick wall, peering into the darkness.\n\n                                     ANDY\n                         SERAFINE!?\n\n               The echo sounds different - like he's in a larger space. The \n               echo decays into a familiar low RUMBLE.\n\n               A reflection of light appears in a puddle on the floor. The \n               light gets brighter until Andy sees the subway tracks at his \n               feet. The rumble gets suddenly louder as\n\n               METRO TRAIN\n\n               barrels around the corner, flooding the tunnel with light \n               and closing on Andy fast.\n\n                                     ANDY\n                         Oh shit!\n\n               He turns and runs for THE STAIRWAY. He skids on the gravel \n               and overshoots it. He scrambles back and up into it just as \n               THE TRAIN whooshes past.\n\n               Andy scurries a few feet up the slick steps, using a rusty \n               pipe for a handhold. As he looks back at the SPARKING, RUSHING \n               TRAIN WHEELS, his heart pounding in his head, he has another \n               HALLUCINATORY-FLASH: the sparks explode into streaking \n               patterns of color and light.\n\n               It passes quickly. The train goes by and its rumble fades. \n               Andy squeezes his temples and takes a deep breath. Before he \n               finishes exhaling, an UNEARTHLY HOWL echoes through the \n               tunnels.

He approaches \n               another intersection. He stumbles over something.\n\n               He looks down and makes out a GIRL'S BARE LEG lying in a \n               puddle in the dark intersecting tunnel.

As it gains on Andy, we see the dim outline of the \n               massive wolf-like beast.\n\n               Andy dives for a SMALL CONDUIT, barely big enough for his \n               body, and wriggles into it. Behind him the yellow eyes appear \n               at the mouth of the conduit - the beast SNARLS but can't fit \n               in. Andy can see a dim light at the end of the conduit.

Relieved, Andy starts off \n               towards it. A SNARL stops him in his tracks. THE BEAST comes \n               tearing around a corner fifty yards behind him.\n\n               Andy breaks into a sprint towards the antechamber.

In the DENSE FOREST OF TALL TOMBSTONES, Amy zigs and zags \n               through narrow spaces, barely wide enough for her slender \n               body to fit through. The camera CRANES UP. \n\nTARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED:\n               HIGH ANGLE\n\n               Thirty paces behind Amy, pairs of tombstones split apart \n               like jungle vegetation, crashing thunderously to the ground. \n               The unseen beast's path is slowed by the monuments, but still \n               follows Amy.\n\n               Amy looks back as she runs. She sees the tops of tombstones \n               fall behind her. She comes to a railing at the top of a \n               fifteen foot wall separating a LOWER LEVEL of the cemetery. \n               She hangs over the edge and quietly drops.\n\n               She runs down a path comes to an intersection where six paths \n               converge. She looks down each of them, but can't see the \n               outer walls of the cemetery - just an endless landscape of \n               graves. She sprints down a path and ducks behind A LARGE \n               CRYPT.\n\n               Up on the higher level, the beast howls. She looks up and \n               sees its silhouette sniffing the air, the full moon looming \n               behind it. She looks up at the iron door on the crypt. Then \n               she reaches into her purse...\n\n               THE BEAST'S POV\n\n               Its HEAVY BREATH dominates the soundtrack. It scans the sprawl \n               of graves from its perch on the hill, sniffing. It locks \n               it's stare on the large crypt. It sniffs again. With a growl, \n               it leaps over the railing (we stay with its POV) and hits \n               the ground running. It runs up a twisting path, closing in \n               on THE CRYPT. It arrives at the back of the crypt and circles \n               it, sniffing. It stops in front of the door.\n\n               THE BEAST'S EYES\n\n               Narrow and glow with intense predatory focus.\n\n               INSIDE THE CRYPT\n\n               We're looking at the door. CRASH! It flies open, revealing \n               the snarling beast, backlit by the moon. It lunges in and \n               stops.\n\n               THE BEAST'S POV\n\n               Scans back and forth - the crypt is empty.

A thousand \n                         years ago the Gauls had a drug \n                         powerful enough to unlock the door \n                         to lycanthropic consciousness, to \n                         full control. It came from \n                         moonsbreath.

He advances towards \n               Andy and Serafine, backing them up against the rear doors of \n               the van.
