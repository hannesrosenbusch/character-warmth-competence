LARGE CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT 1\n\nThrough the window of a Land Rover, we see a construction\nsite working at full capacity. Huge arc lights and\nfloodlights illuminate the scene and men are hard at work.\n\nA group of men are in discussion in a pool of light. There\nis a conversation, then one of the men breaks off and takes a\ncall on his cellphone. He is distant, not even the focal\npoint of the shot. He puts his finger in his ear to hear the\ncall more clearly. He is too far away for us to see his\nreactions or expression but, when he cuts the call, he walks\ndirectly toward the car and the other men turn to watch him\ngo.\n\nAs he gets closer we see he wears a tie and heavy boots and a\nheavy coat. He wears a hard hat. He finds a key fob and\nhits it. The lights inside the car glow in response.\n\nThe man gets into the driver’s seat. He is in his thirties,\na face made of stone and unused to expressions of emotion.\n\nThis is IVAN LOCKE.\n\nHe sits in the driver’s seat for a few moments. He takes a\nbreath and we might guess (or we might not) that he has just\nhad some important news. Is he scared, angry?\n\nHe takes out his cellphone and looks, deciding whether or not\nto make a call. He checks his watch. He decides there isn’t\ntime for the call. He puts the phone away quickly and fires\nthe engine.\n\nHe shifts gear and reverses. We stay with him and will stay\nwith him intensely for the rest of the story.\n\nThe car bumps over rough ground as Ivan heads for the big\nsecure gates that open out onto the street. The construction\nsite is massive and it takes a while to reach the edge of it.\nTrucks rumble and generators roar. This is Ivan’s world.\n\nThe gates are opened by a guy in a high viz jacket. Ivan\nreaches the kerb of the road and indicates right as a reflex.\nBut he doesn’t pull away.\n\nHe realizes that this time he must choose which way he will\ngo.",

Even so, he takes time.\n\nA massive truck pulls up inches behind him and its headlights\nfill Ivan’s car. Ivan continues to make his decision as his\nindicator ticks away the seconds.\n\nThe truck hoots its baleful horn, the voice of fate.\n\nIvan hits the indicator to indicate left instead of right.\nHe turns left and joins light evening traffic.\n\fLocke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 3.\n\nEXT.

On the site\nhe was in a familiar place but now he is on a journey and\nmust necessarily begin to consider the destination and the\nplace he is leaving.\n\nHis first decision is to make a phone call on his hands free\ncar phone. This is an important component of the story so we\nshould take some time establishing the mechanism. He has a\nlong list of speed dial numbers, identified by names or\nlocations.\n\nHe speed dials a number labelled ‘Bastard’...\n\nIVAN\nHello, can I speak to Gareth?\n\nWe hear a woman’s voice from the hands-free phone.

Well,\nhe controlled it.\n\nA pause.\n\nEDDIE (OOV) (CONT'D)\nAnd he got it down on the ground.\nYou know how you say he just lumps\nit forward all the time, well he\ngot it down on the ground. This is\nCaldwell, dad. And he just started\nrunning...\n\nEddie begins to laugh and cry at the same time...\n\nEDDIE (OOV) (CONT'D)\nAnd he was running and running and\nrunning and these defenders were\nbouncing off him.\n\nEddie laughs...\n\nEDDIE (OOV) (CONT'D)\nAnd he went round one, then\nanother, and me and Sean were\nstanding up and shouting at him to\npass the ball. You know how you\nsay you have to square it. He\nwouldn’t square it. He wouldn’t\npass. He just kept running. He\nlooked like a horse or something.\n\nEddie laughs again.\n\nEDDIE (OOV) (CONT'D)\nSo then the goalie is coming\nforward and we think he’s going to\nboot it over the bar. Remember\nagainst whoever it was when he just\nbooted it over the bar.\n\n(MORE)\n\fLocke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 71.\n\nEDDIE (OOV) (CONT'D)\nWe thought it was going to be that\nagain. But he didn’t. This is\nCaldwell dad. The one you say is\nalways a donkey.\n\nA pause.\n\nEDDIE (OOV) (CONT'D)\nHe went round the goalie and put it\nin.\n\nA long pause.\n\nEDDIE (OOV) (CONT'D)\nMum was crying so she didn’t even\nsee it.\n\nA pause.\n\nEDDIE (OOV) (CONT'D)\nBut we recorded it for you so you\nhave to come home to watch it.\nYou’1ll have to come home and I’ve\nhad an idea.

The thin\nsound fills the car and Ivan lets the car slow down on its\nown. Horns hoot and Ivan drifts onto the hard shoulder.\n\nThe car comes to a halt. The sound of the baby crying\ncontinues. Ivan knocks the car out of gear and switches off\nthe engine. A silence around the sound of the baby crying.\n\nIvan listens and glances in the rear view mirror.

He is alone in silence for a few moments.\nWas the birth of a new life worth the destruction of his own?\nIs there redemption in this moment? Ivan doesn’t have an\nanswer. After a moment he fires the engine.\n\nEXT. MOTORWAY GANTRY 20\nFrom a surveillance camera we see Ivan’s car indicate then\npull out into the traffic. After Ivan’s car has gone, we\n\nwatch the other cars on their own journeys, all of them with\ntheir own stories inside their bubbles of light.\n\nTHE END\n\f"
