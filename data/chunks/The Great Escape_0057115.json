And yet through it all runs the\ntheme that even in death man can triumph over any\nobstacle.\n\n\"To my mind this is also the story of a Tower of\nBabel. The fact that this tower was in reverse\nand happened to be a tunnel is a minor point.\nWhat was important then - and is more so now -\nis that this Tower of Babel was successfully\nerected. It proves something important. In one\nmagnificent gesture the seventy-six ragged,\nverminous men of all nationalities who climbed out\nof that stinking hole in the ground in Silesia on\nthat windy March night in 1944 thumbed their\ncollective nose at the entire Third Reich ané all\nit stood for.\n\n\"They triumphed, through the only means left to .\nthem, over an idea that was rotten from the core\nout. And. they proved for all posterity that men,\nworking together, can dig a damned deep hole in\nthe ground - or build a shining Tower of Babel.\n\nGeorge Harsh\"\n\nFrom the introduction to\nPaul Brickhill‘s THE GREAT ESCAPE\n\f+\n\n \n\n“FADE IN:\nExT.
