The United States and the Soviet\nUnion fear each other’s nuclear capabilities - and\nintentions. Both sides deploy spies - and hunt for them.\nINSPIRED BY TRUE EVENTS\n\nCLOSE ON AN ELDERLY MAN\n\nReflected in a grimy mirror. The mirror is propped up on a\nchair next to an open window looking out from the fourth\nfloor onto a Brooklyn skyline.\n\nPull back to show the man sitting in a shabby\nworkshop/studio. He looks from the mirror down at a canvas\nin front of him as he daubs paint onto a self-portrait.\n\nThe telephone rings.\n\nThe old man rests his brush on the easel and walks to a table\ncluttered with papers and shortwave radios. He picks up the\nphone and listens but doesn’t say anything.\n\nFULTON STREET\n\nThe old man, Rudolf Abel, emerges from the building, walks\nalong the street.\n\nTITLE: BROOKLYN\n\nAn Agent follows Abel.\n\nSUBWAY TRAIN INTERIOR\n\nThe Agent watches Abel as the train stops at Broad Street.\nThe Agent, now joined by a second Agent, follows him at a\ndistance. Abel dabs at his nose with a handkerchief. The\nagents lose him in the crush of commuters. They emerge from\nthe station and consult two other Agents. No sign of Abel.\nFirst Agent heads back down the stair, smashing BANG right\ninto Abel, who’s coming up the stairs.\n\nAbel looks up, surprised. Then mildly:\n\nABEL\nExcuse me.\n\nThe agent equally surprised watches as Abel makes his way\naround him.\n\n(CONTINUED)\n\f12.17.14 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 2.\nCONTINUED:\n\nA distant siren fades up and crosses the cut to:\nINT.

He sets down\nhis portable easel and case. Sets his work-in-progress\ncanvass on a standing easel, drapes his jacket over a chair,\nhangs his hat on the easel. He turns on a table fan.\n\nHe fishes the nickel from his pocket, retrieves a razor from\nthe bathroom and uses it to carefully to open it.

The man seems to have left.\n\nAn Agent inspects a closed door. The bathroom -- Rudolf\nAbel steps out, in his briefs. Standing in the doorway,\ncigarette in mouth, we see him as a frail, vulnerable old\n\nman.\n\nHe freezes, not scared, just surprised.
