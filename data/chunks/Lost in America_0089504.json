Happy to have you here and I\nguess all you should know is that\nsome of these children are rude.\n\nDAVID\nWell, all children are rude.\n\nMAN\nWell, these children are a little\nruder than they used to be.

He's leading a group of\nCHILDREN across the street. They are about twelve\nyears old. Obviously, old enough to cross by them-\nselves. David greets them. He wants to make a good\nimpression. God knows why.\n\fDAVID\nHello, children. How was school?\n\nCHILD #1\nScrew you!\n\nCHILD #2\nYeah. Mind your own business.\n\nDAVID\nAh. You must be two of the hungry\nones.\n\nThe Kids glare at him. David walks back across the\nstreet alone. David is waiting. A bunch of KIDS, a\nlittle older, about six of them, walk up.

You want to cross the\nstreet?\n\nOLDER KID #1\nYeah, Retardo.\n\nDAVID\nMy name is David. I would appreciate\nnot being called that name. It's an\nugly name.\n\nOLDER KID #2\nUgly name for an ugly face.\n\nDAVID\nI see no reason to walk future\nprisoners across the street.

If I think someone\nshouldn't be allowed to cross the\nstreet I'm allowed to deny them\nthat privilege. So, if you want\nto cross, you'll have to cross on\nyour own.\n\nOLDER KID #2\nHey, no. No, man. You work for\nus. Let's go.\n\nDAVID\nWhat do you mean let's go? Is\nthat a threat? Be careful. I've\ngot a metal sign here.\n\nOLDER KID #2\n(takes out a knife)\nYeah? I've got a metal knife.\n\nDAVID\nKnife wins. Come on.\n\nHe leads them across the street. David walks back alone,\nmumbling. He sits in his little chair. There's no\naction and no children.
