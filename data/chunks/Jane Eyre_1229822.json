A MIDSUMMER DAWN. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS.\n\n                         \n\n          First light. Jane Eyre is running across a meadow, flushed\n\n          and breathless; the hem of her plain, black dress soaked\n\n          with dew. She carries a shawl and has a small bag of\n\n          belongings over her shoulder.\n\n                         \n\n          She trips, falls to her knees; looks back. Expressive eyes,\n\n          open features. She is desperate. We see the house she is\n\n          running from; a Jacobean battlemented mansion.\n\n                         \n\n          Her need to escape is so great that she crawls forward\n\n          until she is able to raise herself to her feet. She runs.\n\n                         \n\n          She reaches an antique stile by a brook. She lifts herself\n\n          on to it. She lands on the road. And runs.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          I/E. DAY. A ROADSIDE/COACH.\n\n                         \n\n          The sun is higher in the sky. Jane exhausted, now running\n\n          down a main road. Her spirts lift at the sight of an\n\n          approaching coach. She flags it down.\n\n                         \n\n          Jane empties her purse into the driver's hand. He looks at\n\n          her money then suspiciously back at her. A terse nod\n\n          indicates she can get in.\n\n                         \n\n                          CUT TO:\n\n                         \n\n          Jane sinks into a dark corner. Her fellow passengers look\n\n          shocked by her dishevelled appearance at such an early\n\n          hour. She undertakes a tremendous effort not to betray her\n\n          emotional state. She doesn't sob, she doesn't howl -\n\n          although her breathing threatens to. Slowly, unable to bear\n\n          the day, she closes her eyes.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          EXT. EVENING.
