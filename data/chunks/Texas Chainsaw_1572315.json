Regret-\n-tably, not one of the family\nmembers were apprehended, and\nfor more than ten years, noth-\n-ing was further heard. Then,\nover the next several years,\nat least two minor, yet apar-\n-rently related incidents were\nreported. Then again... nothing.\nFor five long years...Silence.\nThen...yet another series of\nrelated incidents occurred...\nNew evidence and studies from\nThe FBI, show that all five of\nthe related incidents were done\nby separate, cannibalistic \nclans, and that none of the in-\n-cidents were connected in any-\n-way. The idea that all have\nused a chainsaw, and show cases\nof cannibalism, necrophelia,\nhomosexuality, and transvestitism,\nare in no way connected to each\nother, and if they are, it is\npurely coincidental. Although\ntheories have circulated, and\nFBI officials have talked, the\nonly worthwhile conclusion is\nthese people, whoever \"They\"\nmay be, use the chainsaw, use\nsodomistic practices, and trans-\nvestitism, as a sign of their\nparticular life style-- a cult.\nReligious, or not religious, \nthey are believed to have prac-\n-ticed the works, of the late\nEd Gein.

The two, both  of them, very different;\nboth in their own way,  might have  not have shared fashion tips, but can carry a\nconversation  all across Texas if they wanted to. They were both: Very  Verbal Women.\n\nThe girl behind the wheel, a persona that leaked through her\npresence,like icing on a hot cake, gave off the appearance\nof the rebel of the group. Her eyes even read \"Bad Ass\nBitch.\"-- as she shoved the gear into fifth, and put it on     cruise control. Her name is\nLeslie FINCH\n\nThe girl (or the more PC term for her is the SCREAM QUEEN)\non the passenger side, gives off no presence. Almost as if\nthere was no presence to give off. All the signs of In-\n-teligent life are on the driver's side. Her name is KATE\nShe, is you typical  BUFFY like character. Y'know, No  brains, and VERY easy. She's\na prep/tramp -- you know the\ntype. KATE puts her book down, shining off a look of sheer\nboredom, and like a tractor beam, she points it in the \ndirection on FINCH, and Finch can't help but look over,\nbecause the innocent looking puppy dog face is\nirresistible.\n\n3\nThe look is making Finch uncomfortable, and she twists her  head around popping her\nneck in long-day discomfort, and  sighs.\n\nKate puts on puppy dog face, her eyes deeper, and more  piercing than before.\n\nFinch loses it.\n\nFINCH\n       (irritated)\nListen!
