All\nof their folkloric and religious beliefs, in this film, are true.\nIt was inspired by various folktales, fairytales and recorded\naccounts (journals, diaries, court records etc.) of historical\nwitches and possessions from New England and Western Europe before\nthe Salem outbreak in 1692. Much of the dialogue, in fact, comes\ndirectly from those sources.\n\nIn order to effectively depict this world in which ordinary people\nunderstood supernatural occurrences to be an expected part of\nlife, it is essential that all aspects of the film to be carried\nout with utter naturalism. The characters must appear as real\nfarmers, not actors with dirty faces. Even the supernatural\nelements must be photographed as realistically as possible. Yet,\nwith all this authenticity and “realism,\" it is still a folktale,\na dream. A nightmare from the past.\n\fBLACK.\n\nTITLE: THE WITCH.\nA New-England Folktale.\n\nINT. MEETING HOUSE.",
