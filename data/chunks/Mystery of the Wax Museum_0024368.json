At the fade in we hear the distant rumbling of \n\tthunder, and shortly thereafter there is a blinding \n\tflash of lightning through the unshuttered windows \n\tshowing in clear relief a brutal, sinister face, the \n\tblack hood and cowl suggesting a medieval monk. We \n\tsee, lying at the foot of the monkish figure, a \n\tseminude figure of a woman whose back is sadly \n\tlacerated. She is lying face down. In the monk's hand \n\tis a knout or cat-o'-nine-tails, as though he had \n\tbeen punishing her.\n\n\tIn the background of this shot we see a workbench and \n\ta work light. The vague figure of Igor is seen, at \n\twork on a nearly completed bust. DOLLY UP TO A \n\tCLOSE-UP of Igor's hands.
