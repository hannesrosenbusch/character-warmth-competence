He watches, BREATHING...\n\n                         \n\n          He touches his chest. Feels his wounds; his missing fingers.\n\n                         \n\n          We reveal that he is standing among the shattered artificial\n\n          faces of mannequins.\n\n                         \n\n          The Shape walks to a tree and takes a seat. His head tilts\n\n          back as his hand presses into his blood stained clothing. His    \n\n          breathing deepens.\n\n                         \n\n          Exhausted, or possibly his last.\n\n                          \n\n\n\n"
