The YOUNG BLACK MAN watches the movements. \n\nSuddenly a white hand strokes the YOUNG BLACK MAN's arm.\n\n\n\nThe WHITE MAN's voice is unnaturally quiet, edgy.

CAZ and TRACY exchange looks.\n\n\n\nJILL is distracted by styles and colours, ears pierced with \n\nmultiple ear-rings, 'granny shoes', tight jeans, baggy \n\ntrousers tightened at the ankles, plastic sandals, cowboy \n\nboots, pointed shoes, collarless shirts, ripped fish-net \n\nstockings, jackets made out of plastic bags, maxi-skirts, \n\nmini-skirts... and that's just the soul crowd! A PUNK then \n\ncatches her attention, he wears a pair of Union Jack briefs \n\ntacked to his jacket. He notices as she laughs.\n\n \n\nTRACY tries to smile at CHRIS, but CAZ is in the way, and \n\nwhen he's with CAZ, CHRIS seems to be avoiding her.\n\n \n\nA BLACK BOY, his hair dyed blond, wearing a very thick, \n\npurple mohair jumper, dances up to TRACY. She accepts the \n\nunspoken invitation to dance. Though the dance involves \n\nholding hands, there is a distance between them. JILL jumps \n\naround with THE UNDERPANT PUNK, sending him and his dance \n\nstyle up...\n\n \n\nThe pattern on the dancefloor changes. People form two \n\ncircles. In the first - two black boys and a white boy. In \n\nthe second - a black boy and black girl. We lose sight of \n\nJILL and TRACY. CHRIS and CAZ sort through their records, \n\nCHRIS keeps an eye open for TRACY.

BILLIBUDD, the \n\npunk who tried to score at the garage, is one of them.\n\n \n\nBILLI has his eyes fixed on CAZ. CAZ notices the cruisy \n\nstare and smiles.\n\n \n\nCHRIS sees JILL and the PUNK, he laughs as she interrogates \n\nthe soft-spoken, middle-class, art-school boy. JILL knocks \n\nback the drink. She nods at CHRIS but her attention is on \n\nthe two men behind him - the men are kissing.\n\n \n\nCHRIS finds TRACY. She's talking to the PUNK DJs. He \n\nhovers, waiting for a chance to speak to her alone. KEN, \n\nthe equipment dealer, bumps into CHRIS. KEN looks out of \n\nplace in the club, he's more an East End pub disco type.
