He looks as if he's down on his luck: shiny pants, slightly frayed collar, \nan old windbreaker. One of life's chronic losers, he is one of those individuals \nwho continue to believe in themselves despite overwhelming evidence to the \ncontrary. This is GUS GORMAN.\n\nBehind the teller's wicket is a middle-aged female CLERK with the requisite \nofficious manner and heart of stone common to her profession.

As theme music continues, the sequence begins.\n\n1.\tComing out the front door of a building is an absolute knockout of a GIRL: \nvoluptuous, sexy, young, and healthy. Her every step casues a series of mind-\nboggling ripples. She is seemingly oblivious to the effect she has on passers-\nby. About 25 years old, this is somebody we will be seeing much more of later. \nLORELEI AMBROSIA.\n\n2.\tAs she walks AWAY FROM CAMERA, her rear end reminding us of the proverbial  \npuppies fighting in a sack, a GUY walking down the street from the opposite \ndirection turns to ogle at her and therefore doesn't look where he's going. He \nbumps into a table-top tray of  TOY WIND-UP PENGUINS being sold by a VENDOR. The \nPENGUINS, about 20 of them, go waddling off in different directions up and down \nthe street.\n\n3.\tA split-second later, a MAN IN A CAP, also walking in the opposite \ndirection, comes abreast of LORELEI, turns to look at her, doesn't see that \nright in front of him (he's near the curb) is a street-sign post. He slams into \nit face first.\n\n4. Clutching his smashed nose, he recoils backwards with a great lurch, banging \nfull-\nforce into a GIRL ON ROLLER SKATES.\n\n5.\tKnocked off balance, wobbling erratically, she swerves and srashes into a \nhot dog wagon on the corner of the street. Standing there, buying a morning \nsnack, is the DAILY PLANET photographer and cub reporter JIMMY OLSEN, on his way \nto the office. The HOT DOG VENDOR has put a frank on a bun and os about to \nsquirt the mustard on it when the ROLLER SKATER crashes into the hot dog wagon. \nThe mustard squirts on Jimmy's face instead and the wagon goes rolling away with \nconsiderable momentum. \n\n6.\tOn the corner of the next street are three telephone booths, side by side. \nIn each booth is a CALLER.",
  "5": "---END OF PREVIOUS SECTION---\n6. On the corner of the next street are three telephone booths, side by side. In each booth is a CALLER. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n The LAST CALLER, A WOMAN, holds onto a leash, which \ndangles outside her phone booth. On the end of this leash is a LITTLE DOG, \nwaiting patiently outside while his mistress talks on the phoneinside. The hot \ndog wagon, picking up speed, hits the first phone booth with considerable \nimpact.\n\n7. Causing a domino effect: the first booth tips over, with the GUY still inside \nit. and hits the second booth, tipping it and its OCCUPANT over, and that in \nturn knocks over the third booth, causing the LADY inside to lose her grip on \nthe leash. Immediately the LITTLE DOG, startled by the crash, goes charging off \ndown the street, trailing his leash.\n\n8. Further down the street is a BLIND MAN holding the handle of the harness \nattached to his SEEING-EYE DOG stands in a doorway. As the LITTLE DOG comes \nrunning by, the SEEING-EYE DOG gets excited and pulls free of his MASTER, \nchasing the other DOG. Startled, the BLIND MAN staggers out into the street, \nfeeling for his DOG, just as:\n\n\n\n9. A AWHITE-LINE ROAD PAINTER workman is coming down the avenue, holding the \nhandle of his motorized line-painting machine, which he is guiding precisely \ndown the center of the street, painting, AS WE SEE a straight white line. He is \ndistracted by the CHARGING DOGS and lets go of his machine momentarily. A moment \nlater, the BLIND MAN staggers out into the road, reaches out and grasps what \nfeels exactly like the handle of his Seeing-eye Dog harness. It ain't. It's the \nline-painting machine.\n\n10. Which now continues down the road guided by a BLIND MAN, and the white line \nbeing painted curves, zig-zags, and bends so that any motorist trying to follow \nit would go berserk.\n\n11. In the meantime, strolling down a side-street, with the characteristically \nspringing step, affable smile for the world, neat suit, hat, and glasses comes \nnone other than CLARK KENT.

He suddenly jumps back as the LITTLE DOG comes \nwhizzing by and instinctively reaches down with super-speed to grab the leash. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n \nThis he does, but if the leash stops, the DOG doesn't. Instead the leash pulls \nfree of the collar, leaving a bemused CLARK standing there holding an empty \nleash.\n\n12. The DOGS whiz by the MAN IN THE CAP (fellow who keeps banging into things \nand getting hurt). As he leaps back to avoid them, he falls into an open \nmanhole.\n\n13. In the middle of the street, the white-line maker \"guided\" by the BLIND MAN, \nis heading for the area of the street where the open manhole is. The BLIND MAN \nloses control of the white-line painter and is about to step into the open hole, \nwhen:\n\n14. The now-capless bald head of the MAN IN THE CAP emerges from the manhole, \njust in time for the BLIND MAN to step right on it (like\ta man crossing a \npond by stepping on the stones). The BLIND MAN, busy whistling for his missing \ndog, never noticed how near to disaster he came, but the bald head of the poor \nMAN IN THE CAP is now imprinted with a black sole marl.\n\n15. The white-line roller, with nobody steering it, crashes into a little \nbarrier that has been set up on the other side of the open manhole. Customary \nsmudge pots mark the barrier. The white-line roller hits a smudge pot.\n\n16. The smudge pot goes rolling across the gutter, stops. From another direction \ncomes one of those TOY PENGUINS. It hits the smudge pot and is immediately set \non fire by the flame.\n\n17. The now flaming PENQUIN continues walking across the street, towards a \nnewspaper stand. Stacked on the curb beside it are a bundle of as-yet-unopened \nnewspapers. The burning toy comes to a stop against the stack, which begins to \nsmoulder.\n\n18. Further down the street is a bank. And just at this moment, running out of \nthe bank, a gun in one hand, a sack of stolen money in the other, comes a BANK \nROBBER. A BANK GUARD races from the bank and gives chase.

The MAN WITH THE LADDER, never realizing what he has done, swings round \n180 degrees with the ladder and the money bag is pulled off the ladder by:\n\n20. The wires of a scaffold where some BUILDING REPAIRMEN stand, just about to \ngo up the side of a building. A second after the sack is deposited on the \nplatform, the scaffold starts to rise.\n\n21. The BANK GUARD fires at the ROBBER, but his shot misses and hits the \nwindshield of a passing car. The windshield shatters and the DRIVER crashes into \na fire hydrant on the curb.\n\n22. Water gushes out of the hydrant, filling up the interior of the car like a \ngoldfish bowl, the DRIVER trapped inside.\n\n23. Across the street, the flaming newspapers have set the entire kiosk on fire.\n\n24. Hearing the screams and shouts, CLARK KENT looks down the street and sees \nwhat's happening. Quickly, he looks around for a place to metamorphose sees \nnone.\n\n25. HE dashes down the street, pausing for a regretful look at the three phone \nbooths on their sides (no way for him there). He spots an open storefront with \none of those Photomat Booths inside, enters it, behind the curtain. We hear a \ncoin drop in the slot; the OCCUPIED sign goes on; the lights flash. A moment \nlater, bursting out of the booth. . . SUPERMAN!\n\n26. He's just about to take off, when he does an \"Oops!\" as he remembers: the \nfour photos drop into the receptacle.

Across the street, the kiosk is engulfed in flames. SUPERMAN lifts the car, \nflies across the street with it and turns it upside down over the fire. The \nwater gushes out and douses the flames.\n\n29. JIMMY OLSEN, watching from the sidewalk, sheers:\n\nJIMMY\n\t\t\t\tWay to go, Superman!\n\n30. Up high on the outside of the building, the WORKERS on the scaffold turn to \nlook \ndown at what's happening on the street. ONE OF THEM kicks the sack of money over \nthe side as he turns to look.\n\n31. In the playground of the park on the next street, a YOUNG MOTHER (or a \nNANNY) lifts a little TODDLER from a baby carriage and sets him on one of end of \na see-saw. Now she starts to walk around it to the other end so that she can \ngive the little fellow a gentle see-saw ride. But before she gets there, the \nfalling money bag lands full force on the (up) end of the see-saw.\n\n32. Which causes the other end to fly upwards, catapulting the TODDLER straight \nup in the air. The YOUNG MOTHER screams.\n\n33. The BABY lands in the topmost branches of a tree and howls.\n\n34. SUPERMAN sees the problem, flies down and rescues the TODDLER. He hands him \nto the YOUNG MOTHER and flies off.\n\n35. THE TWO PAINTERS are on a scaffold, about two stories up on the side of a \nbuilding. One of them turns abruptly as he spots SUPERMAN flying by:\n\nFIRST PAINTER\n\t\t\t\t   (to CO-WORKER)\n\t\t\t\tMike, looks who's here!\n\n\tAnd as he turns, he inadvertently licks over one can of paint on its side, \nPaint slowly \nstarts to drip out and over the side.\n\n36.

The DIGNIFIED GENTLEMAN exits the gallery first. As he steps out, the first \ndrops of paint from the tipped-over paint can above starts to fall. He \nautomatically opens his umbrella at the first sign of falling moisture.\n\n38. After a pause, there seems to be no more precipitation. He closes up his \numbrella. A second later, the entire can of paint falls on his head.\n\n39. He reels backwards from the blow and crashes into a penny gumball machine on \nthe sidewalk (outside an adjacent candy store).\n\n40. The gumball machine crashes to the ground, the glass globe breaks and a \nhundred little gumballs roll onto the sidewalk.\n\n41. Way down the street, the BANK ROBBER is fleeing from the pursuing BANK \nGUARD, constantly looking over his shoulder to see if he's gaining on him.\n\n42. On the other side of the art gallery, PATRONS in a sidewalk café are being \nentertained by one of those STREET PERFORMERS seen everywhere lately . . . a \nsecond-rate Marcel Marceau, i.e. a white-faced, black leotard-garbed MIME. The \nMIME is doing the classic routine of a man climbing a hill against a strong \nwind. He doesn't see the gumballs rolling toward him until it is too late. \nDesperately trying to maintain his routine, his feet start going out of control, \nfaster and faster. he loses balance completely and falls ungracefully on his \nass.\n\n43. The BANK ROBBER dashes down the street, COPS giving chase, and trips on the \nfallen MIME. The sudden halting of his rapid forward motion sends him falling \nstraight forward just as:\n\n44. The oil painting is being carried out of the gallery to a nearby car. The \nBAN KROBBER goes head-first right through the painting.\n\n45.

On street level, LORELEI AMBROSIA comes jiggling down the street, still \nhaving no idea of the events she set in motion.\n\n50. Ahead of her, halfway down the block, a panel truck, its doors open, is \nparked in front of a bakery. A DELIVERY MAN emerges from the bakery, carrying a \ntray of custard pies.\n\n51. The bakery's DELIVERY MAN doesn't see the hot dogs rolling on the sidewalk. \nHe steps on them, trips. This causes:\n\n52. A custard pie to fly up into the air, heading right for the unsuspecting \nkisser of LORELEI, who is walking the other way.\n\n53. CLARK spots what is about to happen and, with a very deft move, slides in \nfront of the momentarily startled girl and, in the same motion, reaches one hand \nup and catches the pie neatly just when it was inches away from her face. Still \nin one smooth motion, CLARK whisks it away and out of sight like a very clever \nwaiter, as LORELEI, who never noticed, continues on.\n\n54.
