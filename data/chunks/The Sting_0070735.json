He pauses a second to dust his\nwhite-winged alligator shoes on the back of his pants legs.\nSharply dressed and surrounded by the aura of one who is\nmaking money for the first time and broadcasting it on all\nbands, he seems an incongruity in this part of town.\n\nWe follow him up a flight of rickety stairs to a second ficor\nflat. He knocks on the door, is admitted by a cautious door-\nman.\n\nINT. NUMBERS SPOT = DAY\n\nSuddenly we are plunged into a room of chattering, clamoring\npeople, This is a spot for the numbers racket, a place\nimmune from legal interference, where any sucker can bet\n\non a number between 1 and 1000 in the hope of getting the\n600 to 1 payoff that goes to those few who guess right. The\nbettors are queued up in several lines before a long table,\nwhere they place their bets and are given receipts in return.\nOthers wait at a cashier's window to pick up previous earn-\nings or to ask fer credit.\n\nMottola moves through the crowd to a back room where betting\nslips are being sorted and meney counted under the watchful\nand somewhat impatient gaze of a Supervisor, an older man\nnamed Mr. Granger, The Yankee-White Sox game is heard on\nthe radio in the background. “\n\nMottola, noticing that his entrance has aroused little inter-\nest, saunters over to the Phone Girl and gives her a little\npinch on the cheek.",
