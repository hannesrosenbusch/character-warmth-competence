The hands rinse the\n\n          towel in a copper bar sink. The stains soften but stay.\n\n          A tan jacket sleeve, spotted the same way, moves INTO\n\n          FRAM. The hands dab the wet towel at the spots, with no\n\n          more success, and throw it into the sink. It falls half\n\n          in, still dripping the stains a drop at a time to the\n\n          floor.\n\n\n\n          ALL IN CLOSEUP\n\n          The owner of the hands walks to a wine rack, opens a\n\n          bottle of white wine, drizzles the wine on the jacket\n\n          sleeve. The stains disappear. He hangs his jacket on a\n\n          hook and walks from\n\n\n\n                         THE CELLAR\n\n          and up the narrow stairs. His FOOTFALLS ECHO against the\n\n          unadorned cement block walls. We see his shape, mid-\n\n          forties, powerful, his shirt pulled out. He's carrying\n\n          the open bottle by the neck.\n\n\n\n          2 INT.

He walks along a narrow aisle\n\n          of wooden diamond bins. As the space widens his foot hits\n\n          something in his path. He bends to find a shoe. He\n\n          glances about nervously. There are shutters on the\n\n          storefront windows. Shoe in hand, he tightens the\n\n          shutters. We see his profile, a good-looking man.\n\n          He walks toward a brighter room at the back of the store,\n\n          the Tasting Room. Now he retrieves a pair of women's\n\n          trousers from the floor, and as he straightens up we see\n\n          his entire face, genial, venial, redeemed by his smile.\n\n          ALEX GATES.

She picks up\n\n          the jacket to brush it and hang it correctly, and glimpses\n\n          the airline tickets tucked in the inside pocket. Suzanne\n\n          smiles, moved.
