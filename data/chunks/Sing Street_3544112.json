Conor stands in\nfront of her.\n\nShe has a great look: lots of black. Good makeup. Back-combed\nhair. Early ‘80s teen-chic. She’s ahead of her time, and\nanything but ordinary.\n\nCONOR\n\nNeed a light?\nGIRL\n\nNo. I’m trying to give up.\nCONOR\n\nCool. I don’t have any matches\n\nanyway.\nSilence.

A loud, energetic punk song crashes in on the\ntrack.\n\nSONG and titles run over:\n\nTITLE SEQUENCE - MONTAGE\n\nA montage of news stories, rock videos, magazine covers,\nheadlines. It's the early eighties, and it's Ireland. Midway\nthrough the worst recession since the 1950s.\n\nTITLE SEQUENCE - MONTAGE\n\nAcross the Irish sea, in London, news reports see Thatcher\nwaving to the crowds. City boys talk into early mobile\ntelephones, getting into sports cars. Armani suits, and gold\ncuff links.\n\nTITLE SEQUENCE - MONTAGE\n\nBut back in Ireland: bombs in the North, petrol queues in the\nSouth. Deserted building sites, bricked-up buildings. More\nblack and white, than London’s Technicolor.\n\nINT. CONOR’S KITCHEN - DAY\n\nWe start to PULL OUT from an old TV set. The 9 o’clock news\nis on. The volume turned down low.\n\fINT. CONOR'’S KITCHEN (CONTINUOUS) - DAY\n\nWe find ourselves in a large kitchen. High ceilings and\nrattling sash windows, in what 100 years ago was a fine\nGeorgian home. Now, things are a little faded. The room is\ncold and unwelcoming. Very little on the shelves. A family on\na budget.\n\nSitting around the kitchen table are: Conor (no black eyes\nyet), and his parents, PENNY and ROBERT, both in their mid\nforties. They’ve just finished a meal of Spag Boll.

The door opens and BRENDAN, (20), tumbles into the\nroom carrying an ash tray, glass of wine, tobacco pouch,\nrolling papers and matches. He sits down at the vacant seat,\nbeside his brother. Brendan has long hair, and a moustache.\nHe’s handsome.\n\nBRENDAN\nThis meeting has been called to\norder.

Go ahead.\n\nBRENDAN\n(to his brother)\nThis is going to be heavy.\n\nROBERT\nWell, as you might have noticed-\nyour mother and I are really\nstruggling at the moment, like the\nrest of the country.

JESUIT SCHOOL SPORTS GROUND - DAY\n\nThis is a large sports ground in a leafy Jesuit school. Nice,\nred brick buildings, very peaceful. It’s the weekend, and\nstudents are practicing track, rugby, cricket. A big copper\nbeech tree shades the Cricket Training net.\n\nConor is at the wicket, bat in hand. Two FRIENDS are playing\nwith him. They all speak with posh, South-side accents.\n\nCONOR\nSo guys, I’m not coming back after\nthe break.\n\nFRIEND 1\n\nThe hell? Why?\n\nCONOR\nThe old pair are moving me to a\ndifferent school.\n\nFRIEND 2\nDicks. Why?\n\nCONOR\nThey say they have no money.\n\nThe ball whizzes past him.

Trust me.\nYou know what’s gotten us to where\nwe are today, us humans? One\nquality?\n\nThey pause at the open door.\n\nFATHER WAITS\nAdaptability.\n\nHe winks, shaking Conor’s hand. Conor shuffles off down the\ncorridor.\n\nFather Waits looks over to his secretary who has been\nlistening. He makes a doubtful expression. She nods in\nagreement.\n\nINT. CHURCH - DAY\n\nA church on a school campus. 30 choir boys are at choir\npractice on the alter. They are dressed in their own cloths.\nThere is no congregation. It’s Saturday rehersal.

BRENDAN’S ROOM - EVENING\n\nBack in his house, we are in Brendan's attic lair. As far\naway from the rest of the house as possible. This small room\nis a shrine to music and art. And hash.\n\nWe have numerous ash trays. A homemade hammock. Posters of\nbands on the walls. Shelves of books on pop art, philosophy,\nand music. A poster of SIGMUND FREUD on the wall next to his\nbed. A voice bubble has been drawn in, saying “It’s all your\nmother’s fault”.\n\nA portable TV on a box. An acoustic guitar with two strings.\nBut most importantly, a huge collection of Vinyl. Proudly\nalphabetized. The only thing so in Brendan's life.\n\nThe windows are blacked out with hanging blankets, and the\nlighting is low; easy on the eternally stoned eye.\n\nBrendan sits in his huge, collapsed armchair in a mist of\nmarijuana smoke, a king of his own domain.

But then realizes, pulling it back.\n\nBRENDAN\nOh, no, you’re tiny.\n\nHe stands up, taking the record that has been playing\nquietly.

SYNGE STREET SCHOOL - MORNING\nSong playing loud.\n\nMonday morning. Almost in answer to his brother’s question,\nConor walks into the gate of the school. Numerous kids have\ngathered in packs. Conor has to walk a gauntlet of new faces.\nHeads turn towards the newcomer. There is something of a\nstranger arriving at a new town in a Western. But this is no\nWestern, and the stomping song tells us so. Conor’s three-\nquarter length smart coat and long curly hair draws laughs.\nHe is also carrying a soft, brown leather satchel, which\ndoesn’t help.\n\nKids smoke in circles. Kids spit on the ground.\n\nFurther into the walk, a fight is just breaking out, anda\nsmall circle is gathering. Two boys beat it out. Bloody noses\nand fists. Conor speeds up as he passes. He notices that\nabove them, at a second story window, a BROTHER (50s), in\nblack suit and white collar, is watching the fight down\nbelow. He does nothing about it.\n\nOne KID has a dead RAT skewered on the end of a stick. He\nchases other kids around with it. He finally throws it at\nConor. It hits him on the side of the head. Others laugh.\n\nThe song ends as he enters the school. The back of his coat\nis covered in spit.\n\nINT. CLASSROOM — DAY\n\nConor sits in a large, drafty classroom, looking around. The\nwindows rattle in the wind. Worn, wooden floorboards\nunderfoot. The desks are mismatched. Two kids per desk.

The hair is done, the make up.\nAnd she’s dressed in a cool skirt, doc boots, and jacket. She\ncan’t believe what she’s seeing. Conor, is singling with his\neyes closed. She smiles, walking through the hall towards the\nstage. Conor sees her and smiles, singing the last verse to\nher. She stands at the front of stage looking up at him.\n\nLYRICS\n“So bring the thunder bring the\nlightening, bring the fall. I know\nI’ll get my heart through. I’ve\nmiles to go, but since the day I\nstarted crawling I was on my way to\nfind you.”\n\nThey finish to applause. A SKINHEAD tries to get up on stage\nbut Barry, who has been standing, arms folded like a\nbodyguard, punches him off the stage.\n\nCONOR\nOkay. This is our last song. It’s\nabout this school. It’s for Brother\nBaxter.\n\nPeople hoot and whistle. Brother Baxter, who stands at the\nback of the hall is not impressed.
