DAY.\n\nSalvador and Mercedes, standing in front of a hole in\nthe ground, it isn’t very deep (about 2 _ feet)\nEverything seems to show that it was Mercedes who dug\nit, or someone who was paid and left as soon as he was\nfinished. Manolo the cat, Salvador’s pet, is lying at\nthe bottom, in a wicker basket. Salvador pushes the\nearth with his foot and it falls on the basket.\n\nCut.\n\nIn the same park. Mercedes is about 50, she has spent\nhalf her life at Salvador’s side, as his assistant in\neverything. Even though he no longer works, they keep\nin touch.\n\nMercedes is the closest thing to a family that Salvador\nhas. Efficient, warm, loyal, special, intelligent and\nnot at all intrusive. There are no secrets between them\nor, if there are, they are minimal and the result of\nrespect.\n\nMercedes and Salvador walk sadly through the park in\nwhich the cat’s remains now rest.\n\nMERCEDES\nDo you want me to bring you a cat\nfrom Cedillo? Or two, so they’re\ncompany for each other.\n\nSALVADOR\nNo, I can’t bend down to stroke\nthem or to put out their food.\n\nMERCEDES\nIf they want to be stroked,\nthey’1l get up on the furniture.\nAnd Maya can put out their food,\nlike she did with Manolo.\n\nSALVADOR\nNo, no. Manolo was the last one.\n\nHe says it as if talking about a last love.\nThey sit on a bench. Mercedes takes a pile of papers\nfrom her purse. Salvador sits on the edge of the bench,\n\nhis torso upright.\n\nMERCEDES\n\fI know that it’s almost always no\nto everything, but they’re doing a\nretrospective of you in Finland\nand they’ve invited you to attend.\n(Salvador shakes his head.)

Your films are still\nalive in the world, Salvador. (And\nlet me remind you that so are\nyou.)\n\n2. HOTEL MIGUEL ANGEL. SWIMMING POOL. INT. DAY.\n(The film could start here)\n\nThe heated pool is empty. We discover Salvador totally\nsubmerged in the water and completely motionless, his\nknees slightly bent and his arms outstretched, as if\nsupported by invisible armrests. (Underwater shot.)\nWeightlessness keeps him in this posture. He just has\nto control his breathing. It’s the most similar\nsensation to being bodiless.\n\nHis head slowly emerges, only as far as his neck, the\nrest of his body remains motionless in the same\nposture. He keeps his eyes closed, he breathes\nsteadily.\n\nHis head submerges again. In this position his body\ndoesn’t suffer any muscular’ tension. Neck, back\nshoulders, knees, the lumbar region, all stiffness\ndisappears. As he doesn’t feel his body, his mind,\nvolatile, is like an open window through which the\nlight and the evening breeze enter. Undoubtedly, the\nmost pleasant sensation of the day.\n\n3. RIVER. EXT. DAY (EARLY 60S)\n\nThe water in the pool transports us to the current ina\nriver, in the early 60s. Salvador is a child of three\n\for four who accompanies his mother to wash clothes in\nthe river of his home village. A very bucolic scene.\n\nSalvador sits astride his mother’s lumbar region (as if\nshe were a mule) while Jacinta carries on washing\nclothes on the wooden washboard. She is accompanied by\nRosita, Marisol and Paqui, all with their respective\nwashboards in the water. It’s hard work which the women\ndo cheerfully. When the sequence starts, they are\nlaughing and little Salvador is overjoyed.\n\nROSITA\nI’d like to be a man so I could\nswim naked in the river.\n\nJACINTA\nWhat an idea, Rosita!\n\nLittle Salvador rides happily on his mother’s back.",

She puts him at her side, on the river\nbank. She gives him a stick so he can play with the\nwater. It looks as if the child is fishing, but he\nlikes listening to the women.\n\n4. RIVER. EXT. DAY. (CONT’D)\n\nWhen she’s on her feet, Rosita asks Marisol to help her\nhang out the sheets.\n\nROSITA\nHelp me hang out the sheets, Mari.\n\nMARISOL\nSing something for us, Rosita.\n\nEach takes a handle of the basin with Rosita’s clean\nclothes and they walk over to some clumps of reeds and\npennyroyal. Rosita starts to sing A tu vera.\n\nROSITA\nA tu vera, a tu vera,\nsiempre a la verita tuya,\nsiempre a la verita tuya\naunque yo de pena muera.\n\fSalvador plays with the stick in the water. Jacinta and\nPaqui sing the song while they scrub the clothes on the\nwooden washboards.\n\nSalvador looks at his mother in profile, with her skin\ngleaming with sweat, a straw hat and a headscarf to tie\nback her hair and protect her from the sun. Jacinta\nsmiles back at the child as she sings.\n\nThe soap, made at home from fat left over from cooking,\ndoesn’t produce foam but it leaves (non-contaminating)\nlumps on the surface of the water. For the little fish,\nthe lumps are delicious and they come up to the surface\nin little shoals. The child studies that natural\nfishbowl, fascinated, and chases after them with his\nstick.\n\nMOTHER\nLook, the little soap fish are\nhere.\nDon’t you move, Salvita.\nPaqui, will you help me with the\nbasin?\n\nThe two women take the basin full of clean clothes and\ngo over to where Rosita and Marisol are singing.

HOTEL MIGUEL ANGEL. SWIMMING POOL. INT. DAY. (THE\nPRESENT)\n\nAn underwater shot travels over Salvador’s body from\nthe waist up. A large scar divides his back from the\nsacrum to the dorsal region. When the camera is\narriving at his shoulders, the present day Salvador’s\nhead emerges to reality. He remains in the hotel pool\nfor a few moments.\n\f6. HOTEL MIGUEL ANGEL. CAFETERIA. DAY.\n\nSalvador crosses the spacious cafeteria of the Hotel\nMiguel Angel with a medium-sized sports bag. He walks\nin a peculiar way, with his torso rigid and his\nshoulders slightly slanted forward, but not so much as\nto attract attention. Sitting at a table is Zulema\nGoldstein, having a coffee and checking her iPhone. She\nlooks up, pensive, and sees Salvador in the distance.\nShe hesitates at first, but when he is about to pass\nher table she calls to him, delighted.\n\nZULEMA\nSalva!\n\nSalvador is walking along, distracted. He looks at her.\nAlthough he is near the woman, he has trouble\n\nrecognizing her.\n\nZULEMA\nI’m Zulema!\n\nSalvador goes up to her and gives her a kiss.\n\nSALVADOR\nZulema!\nZULEMA\nWhat a surprise! This is\n\nwonderful! Have you time for a\ncoffee or are you in a hurry?\n\nSalvador, with an effort, sits on the edge of the\narmchair.\n\nZulema is more or less Salvador’s age (60), but she\nlooks younger. Attractive, she takes very good care of\nherself. They almost failed to recognize each other,\nbut both conceal that. She speaks with a = soft\nArgentinean accent.\n\nCut.\n\n7. HOTEL MIGUEL ANGEL.",

The pianist has\njust sat down. He starts to play a melody.\n\n8. SCHOOL. LARGE MULTI-USE GYM. INT. DAY. (1966)\n\nWe continue to hear the same melody, this time played\nby a priest in the school’s large gym. The floor has\nvarious geometrical marks (made with different colored\nstrips of adhesive tape stuck to the parquet floor) for\npracticing different sports. One of the side walls is\ncovered with gym bars.\n\nThe priest and the piano are at the far end.\n\nThe door opens and a group of young boys in short pants\ncome in. Pupils. They are accompanied by a big-bottomed\npriest who signals to them to form up in two lines next\nto the piano. Once the lines are formed, the big-\nbottomed priest disappears.\n\nThe first priest, at the piano, finishes the song he’s\nplaying.

He plays a piece of a melody on the piano\n(intervals with Ta ra ra). He makes him repeat it with\nincreasingly higher notes. This way he can check if he\nhas a good ear and also his tessitura. The result is\neven worse than the previous one, the boys sing off key\nwith impunity, they are unaware of it.\nCut.\n\n10. SCHOOL. LARGE GYM. INT.

During this abstract melody we hear Salvador\noff screen.\n\nSALVADOR OFF\n\nThe priests decided that I\nwouldn’t attend geography or\nhistory classes, or science or\nhistory of art.

GEOGRAPHY .\n\nThe screen is filled with the word GEOGRAPHY, as the\ntitle of the following chapter. A musical theme\ndialogues with Salvador’s off-screen text without\ninterfering with what he says. The same theme will link\nwith ANATOMY.\n\nSALVADOR OFF\nWith time, I became a film\ndirector and I started to learn\nSpanish geography while traveling\nto promote the films I directed.\n\nBoth Geography and Anatomy function as two clips, whose\nlyrics are Salvador’s monologues.

(Signed) Eduardo.\n(Followed by an address in\nBilbao).\n\nSalvador is touched by the dedication. Mercedes looks\nat him without saying anything.\n\n127. SALVADOR’S HOUSE. INT. DAY.\n\nThe drawing is part of the desk. We hear the song Come\nsinfonia sung by Mina. The same song as was playing on\nthe transistor when Eduardo drew Salvador, fifty years\nbefore.\n\nFrom the start of this sequence we hear the sound of\ntyping on a computer. Salvador is writing quickly, as\nif he were short of time. We see the title at the top\nof the document: THE FIRST DESIRE.\n\nAs well as hearing Mina’s song, we see it, on the\nscreen of Salvador’s cell phone, a YouTube video, in\nblack and white, from that time.\n\nMercedes comes into the study area. She seems him so\ndeep in concentration that she doesn’t want to disturb\nhim. She loves to see him writing.\n\nSalvador is writing very quickly on the computer. He\nlooks at the clock.\n\fMERCEDES\n(Serious, tender, trying to sound\nneutral) You have to start\ndressing in half an hour.\n\nSalvador, without pausing in his writing:\n\nSALVADOR\nRemind me just before.\n\nHis expression has changed, he’s a different Salvador,\ncalm, he writes with ten fingers, he doesn’t need to\nlook at the keyboard.\n\n128. STREET IN MADRID. INSIDE THE VAN. INT./EXT. DAY.\nOn the way to the hospital.\n\nSalvador is looking out the window at life in the city.\nHe is serious. A middle-aged father pushing a double\npram with a set of twins. A South American woman\nhelping an elderly lady to walk. The shouting of a\ngroup of adolescents, several people with dogs, men and\nwomen isolated by headphones or talking on their\nphones.\n\nMERCEDES\nWhat do you think happened with\nthe drawing?\n\nSALVADOR\nEduardo sent it to Paterna, my\nmother would have received it. I\nwas at the priests’ school by then\nand she didn’t send it to me or\ntold me about it.\n\nMERCEDES\nNever?\nSALVADOR\nNever.\nPensive.",

Pensive. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\nMERCEDES\n\nAre you going to try to find him?\n\nSALVADOR\nEduardo?\n\fMERCEDES\nIt’s easier now, with Google. Or\ngoing back to Paterna and asking\nabout him.\n\nSALVADOR\nFifty years later? (He shakes his\nhead.) It’s a good idea for a\nstory and maybe I'll write it, but\nlooking for him would be crazy.\n\nMERCEDES\nHow on earth did the drawing get\nto the Flea Market in Barcelona?\n\nSALVADOR\nNo idea. By chance, but what\nmatters is that it got to the\nperson it was intended for.\n\n129. HOSPITAL. OPERATING THEATER. INT. DAY.\n\nSome nurses wheel Salvador in on a gurney. General view\nof the operating theater.\n\nDr. Galindo is the anesthetist, he goes over to the\ngurney. They greet each other amicably. Salvador is\nreassured by the doctor’s presence. The atmosphere is\ntypical of an operation.\n\nDR. GALINDO\n(In a mask and cap) How are you,\nSalvador?\n\nSALVADOR\nHello, doctor.\n\nDR. GALINDO\nI heard. No wonder you couldn’t\nswallow. But don’t worry, we’ll\nget rid of this right away.\n\nSalvador smiles. Despite the fear inherent to the\nsituation, he is calm. The doctor prepares’ the\nanesthetic.\n\nSALVADOR\nDoctor, I’m writing again.\n\fHe says it in the tone of “and I’d like to keep doing\nit’.\n\nDR. GALINDO\n(Injecting the anesthetic) Really?\nThat’s great news! I’m delighted,\nSalvador. Drama or comedy?\n\nSALVADOR\nI don’t know. You don’t know that...\n\nHe is about to say “until the end” but the anesthetic\ntraps him sweetly before he can finish the sentence.\n\n130. TRAIN STATION. EXT. NIGHT.

NIGHT.\n\fThe mother spreads a blanket on the floor to make a\nbed. Outside the orgy of fireworks continues. They are\nsurrounded by bundles. The boy lies on the wooden\nbench, wrapped in a blanket and with a bundle as a\npillow. The mother lies on the makeshift bed on the\nfloor. She is staring into space, probably trying to\nimagine their future. In that relaxed tone that\nprecedes sleep, mother and child talk:\n\nSALVADOR\nMom, will there be a cinema in\nPaterna?\n\nMOTHER\n\nIf we have a house that’1l be\nenough for me, love.\n\nThe boy rolls over, turning his back on his mother.\nJacinta thinks of the destiny that awaits her family.\nIn her eyes there is uncertainty, fear and hope.\n\nThe camera starts to pull back.\n\n133. | TRAIN STATION.

The\nrepresented past and the present coexist separated only\nby the rails of a little tracking shot.\n\nSitting on the blanket, Penélope looks over at\nSalvador, the director.
