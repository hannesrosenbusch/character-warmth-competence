The house has no architectural \ncharacter; it is not certain where we are. Near the entrance \ndoor is a garbage can, full.\n\nA dog is nibbling at some of the garbage. We hear whistling, \nfootsteps. A garbage man comes into the picture. He shoos \nthe dog away. Without pause in whistling, he lifts the \ngarbage can and, followed by camera, goes to the end of the \nblock, which is only a few steps. Now we discover we are in \nVenice. In the background is a major canal and a typical \nbridge--romantic background. Gondolas are passing. In the \nforeground at the sidewalk is the garbage gondola, piled \nhigh with garbage. The man dumps his load, leaves the empty \ncan on the sidewalk, gets in the gondola, and paddles away \nwith the grace of a gondolier. Now, in a beautiful tenor \nvoice which is quite a contrast to the garbage, he starts \nsinging a passionate Italian love song.\n \nLONG SHOT  A GONDOLA \nTwo tourists. Husband and wife. They are in a sentimental \nembrace. In back is the gondolier. Camera follows gondola \na few seconds, coming closer.\n \nANOTHER GONDOLA \nCamera shoots down. Gondola is covered by a typical little \ncanopy, so that gondolier cannot see the passengers. Camera \ncuts canopy on one side so that we don't see, at first, who \nis paddling. In the gondola seat is a woman in evening gown, \nlots of jewels. She lies in the arms of the gondolier. They \nkiss. Camera moves up and discovers who is paddling the \nboat. It is the husband of the lady who is having such a \ngood time with the gondolier. Husband is in tuxedo and \nstraw hat, smoking a long cigar. He is enjoying it like a \nchild with a new toy.\n \n\t\t\tHUSBAND\n\tDarling!\n \n\t\t\tWIFE'S VOICE\n\tYes, sweetheart.",

SHOT \nIn the background is an open window with French doors \nleading to a little balcony. This room is on the other \nside of the hotel, looking out on a side canal.
