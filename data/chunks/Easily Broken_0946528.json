He taps Dave on the shoulder.\n\nBISHOP WILKES\nHow about saving some for the\nhoneymoon, brother?\n\nDave and Clarice break their clutch, slightly embarrassed,\nand the audience erupts in LAUGHTER and a few HOOTS and\nHOLLAS from some of the men, including handsome, young Best\nMan BROCK HOUSEMAN, the lone Caucasian member of the wedding\nparty.

Clarice, before I present\nyou as husband and wife, there’s\none last lesson I want to leave\nwith you as you begin your life\ntogether. A wise king named\nSolomon once said this:\n\n(reading from Bible)\n\n“It is better to have a partner\nthan go through life alone. Share\nthe work, share the wealth, for if\none falls down, the other is there\nto pick him up. But pity the man\nwho falls and has no one by his\nside. And in bed, two can warm\neach other at night. But one\nalone, shivers all night long. By\nyourself, you are unprotected. But\nwith a partner you can face the\nworst the world has to offer. But\neven better is a cord of three\nstrands because it is not easily\n\nbroken.”\n(beat, closing his Bible)\nMy brother, my sister... I’1l be\n\nhonest with you.

The\ntwo of you represent the first two\nstrands, but God represent the\nthird. And as long as you stay\nclose to God and His family, I\npromise your marriage will be a\nthree-stranded cord that nothing in\nthis world can break.\n\nAnd as Dave and Clarice nod that they understand the\nadmonition, we’ll FIND Clarice’s 50-something, very strong-\nwilled mother, MARY CLARK, or MAMA as we will come to know\nher, sitting all by herself in the front row.
