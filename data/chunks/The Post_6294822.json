He has a red pencil in hand and reads the\ndraft of a story: “Senate Told Nixon Aid to Laos Illegal”.\n\nChryon: June 9, 1971\n\nBradlee rubs his eyes and looks around the room. There are\nMEN scattered amongst the tables reading newspapers. Bradlee\nsquints to get a better look - every paper is “The New York\nTimes”. He frowns and looks back at the story - bored.\n\nKAY (0.S.)\nAm I late?\n\nKATHARINE “KAY” GRAHAM (mid 50s) speaks with trained intent -\nnever letting something slip that she hasn’t considered many\ntimes over.

The waiter leaves.\nKAY\n\nIs there something you wanted to\ntalk about?\n\fHe reaches into his bag and pulls out a magazine, folded to a\ncertain page, and shows it to her.\n\nBRADLEE\nHave you seen this?\n\nKAY\nOf course.\n\nShe doesn’t take it as he intended, so now it hangs limply\nbetween them.
