  "1": "“CITY ISLAND”\n\nby\n\nRaymond De Felitta\n\fINT. NORTH JERSEY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY DAY\n\nA dank and cheerless cell-block. Two Correctional Officers\n\nexamine the cells, making sure all inmates are present. One\nof the officers is middle-aged, tough but not scary-tough.\n\nThis is VINCENT RIZZO.\n\nVince Rizzo calls out the names of the prisoners as they\npass the cells.\n\nVINCE\nNakovny...Napperfork..Nardella...\n\nThis last name makes him pause. He stops and stares into the\ncell at a YOUNG INMATE who glowers back.\n\nVINCE (V.O.)\nYou asked me my worst secret. My most\npersonal secret. The secret of all my\nsecrets. I get it.\n\nVince stares at the young man named Nardella. And then,\nreluctantly, moves on.\n\nVINCE (V.O.)\nBut first..I’m Vince Rizzo and I want to begin\nby telling you about where I live.\n\nCREDIT SEQUENCE\n1. EXT. CITY ISLAND THE BRONX DAY\n\nBoats in the harbor. Sunlight glinting off the water. Old\nclapboard houses set in what appears to be a genuine fishing\nvillage. All with a view of Manhattan.\n\nVINCE (V.O.)\nCity Island is a fishing village, located\nin the Bronx, New York, a place most people\nassociate with machete’s, chop-shops, the\nSon of Sam, gang warfare and the once great\nNew York Yankees.\n\nSHOTS OF FAMILIES LEAVING THEIR HOUSES FOR WORK\n\nVINCE (V.O.)\nThe Bronx is all these things. But it is also\nhome to the families that are the infra-\nstructure of the greatest city in the world—\nthe fireman, the cab-drivers, the sanitation\nworkers, the secretaries, the teachers and\nthe cops. And the guys who work in our local\nprisons. Like myself\n\fMORE SHOTS OF CITY ISLAND\n\nThe locals opening their shops in the morning, bidding\neach other a good day.\n\nVINCE (V.0.)\nNow: City Island is distinct from the rest\nof the Bronx by virtue of being located on\nit’s own two lane spit, right in the middle\nof the Sound.",

Like myself\n\fMORE SHOTS OF CITY ISLAND\n\nThe locals opening their shops in the morning, bidding\neach other a good day. VINCE (V.0.)\nNow: City Island is distinct from the rest\nof the Bronx by virtue of being located on\nit’s own two lane spit, right in the middle\nof the Sound. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n Most people don’t believe it\nuntil they see it. And within the one square\nmile that comprises all there is of City\nIsland lies another distinction. That of the\nmuscle-sucker versus the clam digger.\n\nSHOTS OF THE BOAT WORKERS IN THE HARBOR\n\nVINCE (V.O.)\nThe ‘muscle-sucker’ is an island resident who\nmoved here from somewhere else. The ‘clam-\ndigger’, however, was born and bred on City\nIsland, preferably in the same house that’s\nbeen handed down through the generations.\nMyself, I'm a clam-digger. There’s quite a\nfew of us. Houses don’t go up for sale here\neveryday. My grandparents built our house in\n1924. My dad grew up here. So did I. My kids\ndid too. And this goes to the heart of why it\nmatters so much to a clam-digger to be what\nhe is and not some mussel-sucker.\n\n2. EXT. RIZZO HOUSE DAY\n\nThe Rizzo family home at the end of the cul-de-sac, which\nsits on the water. Quaint, but not well kept. A Jeep and a\nDodge Rambler sit on the ill-kept front lawn.\n\nVINCE (V.O.)\nBecause we represent family, continuity,\nstability. And in the Bronx—hell, in the\nworld as we know it—these qualities are in\nincreasingly short supply. In short, the\nworld can be divided between clam-diggers and\nmussel suckers. Those who stay, and those who\nwander. But I digress. You asked me my worst\nsecret. My most personal secret. The secret\nof all my secrets. Well..like most of us, I\nguess I have a few.\n\nFrom an upstairs side-window, we see SMOKE. Not billowing\nor threatening, just gently emerging from the window.\n\f3. INT. RIZZO HOUSE DAY\n\nJOYCE RIZZO is getting dressed in a hurry. Great body. Savvy\neyes. Men of a certain generation would call her\n\nfoxy. Morning news blares from a television.
