BELMONT NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT\n\n         A full moon glows in the sky.  As we tilt downwards, Christmas\n\n         lights twinkle silently in the windows of a courtyard brownstone.\n\n         The cold December wind howls forlornly.  Although the street\n\n         is empty, CHRISTMAS CAROLERS can be seen singing in front\n\n         of one of the buildings.\n\n\n\n         As the carolers move along, a WOMAN appears.  Groceries in\n\n         tow, she makes her way through the courtyard of her building\n\n         APPROACHING the doorway.  Fumbling with her keys, she\n\n         enters.\n\n\n\n2.       INT.  COURTYARD BUILDING FOYER - NIGHT\n\n\n\n         Adjusting a small lightbulb on the wall in the foyer so that she\n\n         can see, the woman begins for the staircase but stops on seeing\n\n         a small package that's been left at its base.\n\n\n\n         THE PACKAGE\n\n\n\n         is two-tiered.  Wrapped in green, it is tightly secured by a\n\n         bright red ribbon and bow.  Underneath the ribbon, a white\n\n         envelope peeks out with the name \"KRISTINE\" written on it.\n\n\n\n         THE WOMAN\n\n\n\n         shakes her head in disbelief and approaches the gift slowly.\n\n         After kneeling to scoop it up, she gazes at it for a moment and\n\n         after tearing open the card, discovers it is signed: \"WITH LOVE,\n\n         NICK.\"  Sighing heavily in exasperation, KRISTINE scowls.\n\n\n\n                                                      CUT TO:\n\n\n\n3.       INT.  APARTMENT BEDROOM - EARLY A.M.\n\n\n\n         The bedroom lays quiet.  Although the drapes have been drawn to\n\n         keep out the first rays of sunlight, it is grey and overcast\n\n         outside.  Against one wall on a mattress, an unseen lump\n\n         slumbers uneasily beneath twisted bed sheets.\n\n\n\n         Near the bed, we can see the soft neon glow of a digital clock\n\n         radio on the nightstand shift from 6:59 to 7:00.",

EXT.  APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING\n\n\n\n         A Chicago newspaper with the headline AUTO PLANT LAYS OFF\n\n         50,000 WORKERS lies on the stoop.  A byline story adds ECONOMY\n\n         CAN'T FIND YULE CHEER.  Another story at the bottom of the page\n\n         reads CHURCH ROBBED OF CHRIST CHILD STATUE.  The paper is\n\n         dated DECEMBER 24TH.\n\n\n\n         A FIGURE EXITS THE FOYER in a robe and slippers.  Reaching down,\n\n         he picks up the paper and glances at the front page.  26.

CHICAGO CITY STREET - MORNING\n\n\n\n         The skyline of Chicago looms wide-shouldered beneath a steel\n\n         grey sky.  Dreary is an understatement- this is a Chicago winter.\n\n\n\n         On Lake Shore Drive, a rain and dirt streaked Celica drifts\n\n         along an entry ramp signaling it's intention to merge with\n\n         oncoming traffic.  Once clear, it quickly enters the open\n\n         lane and is almost side-swept by a speeding MAZDA ZX.\n\n\n\n6.       INT.",

On the car radio, the Phil Spector version of\n\n         \"Sleigh Ride\" can be heard.  Twisting the wheel sharply, Nick\n\n         angrily fixes his gaze on the car that has almost run him off the\n\n         road and filled with adrenaline, he hits the gas.\n\n\n\n7.       EXT.

Ignoring the signals, some pedestrians\n\n         walk into the street causing even more congestion.\n\n\n\n         On the sidewalk, a man dressed in a Santa Claus suit rings a\n\n         bell to attract last minute shoppers.  He waves as Nick passes.\n\n\n\n         Up the street, shoppers bustle hurriedly in and out of the\n\n         various storefronts oblivious of each other.  One woman with\n\n         two kids in tow argues angrily with a meter maid who is about\n\n         to issue her a ticket because the meter just expired.\n\n\n\n         At another corner, a couple just off work meet and enter a bar\n\n         for a drink with some friends before retiring home for the\n\n         evening. They ignore a disabled panhandler begging near the door.\n\n\n\n         PASSING A CEMETERY\n\n\n\n         Nick sees a solitary old man kneeling.  Laying a wreath at the\n\n         grave of his deceased wife, he then rises and crosses himself.\n\n\n\n         AS IT STARTS TO GET DARK\n\n\n\n         Nick sees a Christmas tree lot closing up shop.  Along the\n\n         sidewalk, some indigent people shuffle slowly in no particular\n\n         hurry since they have no home to go to.\n\n\n\n13.      INT.",

In an instant, Nick enters the\n\n         creative hodgepodge of his darkened apartment and in flipping\n\n         on the light, reveals all of his dreams and frustrations.\n\n         In the livingroom, a drawing board stands in mute testimony\n\n         to the dozens of sketches in various states of completion\n\n         taped to it.\n\n\n\n         Along with Nick's graduation certificates, some framed movie\n\n         posters on the wall overlook an entire shelf bursting at its seams\n\n         with movie books.  In the front room, a cluttered PC workstation\n\n         is situated between an artificial fireplace and steamed up bay\n\n         window.  Piled on top of the television cabinet nestled in one\n\n         corner are some videotapes while next to where the couch is, a\n\n         dwarf-sized Christmas tree decorated with dimestore ornaments\n\n         tilts uneasily to one side.\n\n\n\n         NICK\n\n\n\n         dumps his packages on the couch.

As the song winds down, a special film loop\n\n         in the projection booth causes it to look as if it's SNOWING\n\n         within the theater.

SIX CORNERS - LATE NIGHT\n\n\n\n         Nick walks through the silent snow swept streets.  Around him,\n\n         the three streets Belmont, Lincoln and Ashland crisscross.  At\n\n         the streets' juncture is a wide open intersection overwhich the\n\n         abandoned hulk of an out-of-business department store looms.\n\n         Christmas decorations are visible on some buildings, as well as\n\n         twinkling lights.  The avenue itself though, with the exception\n\n         of one or two passing cars, is barren.\n\n         NICK\n\n\n\n         looks up at the sky, focusing on the constellations.\n\n         One star shines brighter than the others, TWINKLING in the night.\n\n         Nick snorts cynically.  For a moment though, he suddenly\n\n         imagines that he hears angels singing.  Realizing that the idea\n\n         is absurd, he focuses back on the street and sees beyond the\n\n         darkened storefronts a Gothic CHURCH SPIRE cutting upwards\n\n         through the low drifting clouds.  Curious as to the origin of\n\n         the singing, Nick starts walking-\n\n23.      EXT.  ST. ALPHONSUS CHURCH - MIDNIGHT\n\n\n\n         Nick finds himself standing in front of ST.",

On each of the four walls situated at the base\n\n         of the steeple, a Roman numeral clock face bears the time 12\n\n         O'CLOCK MIDNIGHT.\n\n         Nick gazes at the open doors of St. Alphonsus.  A few latecomers\n\n         can be seen arriving.  Drifting towards the steps, Nick joins\n\n         their ranks and enters.\n\n\n\n24.      INT.  ST. ALPHONSUS CHURCH - MIDNIGHT\n\n\n\n         The church is only half-full, not quite matching the numbers\n\n         seen earlier within the Music Box.  A CHOIR sings \"O HOLY\n\n         NIGHT\" in a loft at the rear.  Entering from the back, Nick looks\n\n         about taking in the solid stone columns and meticulously\n\n         varnished woodwork.  Interspersed along the walls between a\n\n         half-dozen confessionals are brass plaques depicting the\n\n         stations of the cross.  Overlooking the altar is a stained glass\n\n         window with a giant crucifix hanging in front of it.  Off and to\n\n         the side is a small NATIVITY CRÈCHE.\n\n         Passing some worshippers, Nick advances respectfully up a side\n\n         aisle towards the front of the church so that he may get a better\n\n         view of the CRÈCHE.  Approaching it, he stops to notice that the\n\n         CHRIST CHILD FIGURE is missing.\n\n         Nick looks around at the congregation gathered for the midnight\n\n         service.  No one seems to notice that the Christ Child figure is\n\n         gone.
