YOUNG BOY’S BEDROOM —- MORNING\n\nNot your typical 12 year old’s room. It’s bare - not\nmany toys, a few books. The proprietor of this room:\n\nCHARLIE SANDIN - lies asleep in bed. Light spills\nthrough blinds, waking him. He sits up, ready to start\nhis day.\n\nCharlie immediately grabs a WRIST WATCH from his night\ntable - puts it on and presses a BUTTON on it - changing\nthe watches’ display from CLOCK to MEDICAL MONITOR which\nbegins BEEPING (an audio presentation of his pulse rate).\nAfter a moment, the WATCH displays CHARLIE’S HEART RATE\n(55) and TEMPERATURE (98.5).\n\nCharlie then picks up a CALENDAR BOOK - rifles through\nPAGES, on which we see that Charlie has written down his\nHEART RATE and TEMPERATURE every morning for the last 5\nyears. He reaches today’s date, when his eyes fall on\nthe page’s HEADER - MARCH 21 - THE ANNUAL PURGE. And\nCharlie's face suddenly tightens with worry.\n\nCharlie writes down his VITALS, then abruptly closes the\nbook - as if trying to hide the DATE that’s unsettled\nhim. But his expression tells us he isn’t successful.\n\nCharlie then stands and approaches his DRESSER. He opens\na DRAWER, rifles through clothes, and does something odd;\nhe puts on another t-shirt over his shirt. He then puts\non yet another t-shirt over that. And he’s not finished;\nCharlie puts on two more pairs of underwear. And as he\nstands there, all layered up, we notice that Charlie’s a\nhandsome boy, but there’s something strange about him, in\nthe way he moves, the way he stares off.\n\nCharlie then proceeds to his CLOSET. He opens it and\nstrangely walks INTO the closet, disappearing between\nHANGING CLOTHES - when his skinny arm reaches back and\ncloses the closet door - shutting us out - and himself in\nfor some reason.\n\fINT.
