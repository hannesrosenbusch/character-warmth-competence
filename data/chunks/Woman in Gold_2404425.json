Firstly, like my\nopponents in this case I always\nbelieved that this was a domestic\nmatter for Austria that needed to\nbe decided within her borders.\n\nSuddenly he’s interrupted: a door opens at the back of the\nroom. His eyes are drawn to it. It’s Maria. She’s come after\nall. She walks up to the front of the room and sits.

This time I came back for\nyou. Now, stand up straight.\n\nHe looks at her, takes strength from her words, straightens\nup, and resumes his opening speech - she has moved and\ninspired him. He takes a deep breath and he looks two inches\ntaller. And the speech is now driven by a new confidence.\n\nRANDY\nAnd the second reason I’m happy to\nbe in Vienna today is because my\nclient Mrs. Altmann and I are both\nAustrians.\n\nSome of the audience seem surprised but Maria knows what he\nmeans.\n\nRANDY (CONT'D)\n\nOh, don’t get me wrong, we’re very\nmuch Americans too.
