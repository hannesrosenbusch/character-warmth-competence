HIGH SCHOOL SOCCER STADIUM, RURAL JAMAICA ~ DAWN\n\n(ROLL CREDITS, A REGGAE VERSION OF THE BEATLES' \"HERE COMES\nTHE SUN\" KICKS IN)\n\nThe tropical sun pokes its mighty head over the lush green\nhills creating a peaceful early morning mist that falls over\na beat-up soccer field and the crude dirt track that\nSurrounds it.\n\nA rooster's crowing breaks the eerie silence as a ghost like\nfigure circles the track.\n\nThis is no weekend jogger. This is: DERICE BANNOCK, Olympic\nhopeful and one of the island's top sprinters. Derice has the\nface of an African Prince and the long fluid stride of a4\nchampion.\n\nHe goes along at an easy pace, then, before you can blink an\neye, he's sprinting down the straightaway like he was shot\nout of a cannon.\n\nHe stretches forward as if he were breaking an imaginary\ntape. Derice pulls back to a jog and begins his ‘victory lap'\nwaving to the imaginary crowd, one athlete, alone with his\ndream, running in the early morning mist.\n\nEXT.

The sign above it reads ‘UNCLE FERTE'S.' In front of\nthe stand, JOSEPH, an old retired fisherman plays dominoes by\nhimself on a wobbly card table.\n\nJOSEPH\nHere he comes!\n\nUNCLE FERTE, a seventy year-old man with kind eyes and\nleathery skin, comes out from behind the stand with a bottle\nof water.\nDerice grabs the bottle without breaking stride.\nFERTE\n(calling after)\nGo get ‘em, tiger!\n\nFerte comes over to Joseph.

It\nlooks like total chaos. Sanka has moved up five rows in the\nfirst thirty seconds.\n\nCLOSE ON: Sanka's cart; he's weaving and bobbing avoiding\ntraffic, throwing his weight from side to side.

It bump wheels\nwith Sanka and tries to drive him off the road. Sanka holds\nhis ground and even takes a slight advantage.\n\nThe funky blue cart's DRIVER is pissed. He tries to ram\nSanka, but Sanka whips the wheel hard. The blue cart's driver\nmisses Sanka badly and smashes into the hay bails that line\nthe racing strip.
