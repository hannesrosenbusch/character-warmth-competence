SIDE STREET  MED. SHOT\n\tIn front of a low brick building is an Italian with a street piano and \n\the is grinding out that always popular classic of the East Side, \"The \n\tSidewalks of New York.\" The kids come into the scene and gather around \n\tthe hurdy-gurdy.\n \n5.\tCLOSE-UP  GROUP \n\tThe Italian smiles as the children start dancing about.
