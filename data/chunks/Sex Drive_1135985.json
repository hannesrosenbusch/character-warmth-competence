All\nwe see are people and lights. Everyone is either dancing,\ntalking or making out. Arrive behind a petit brunette with a\nbody that has precipitated many a boner. MS. TASTY turns\nrevealing a sweet, stunning twenty-year-old smile.\n\nMS. TASTY\nIan! Hey, sweetie! (Strikes a\nsexy pose) So? What do you think?\n\nReverse to show who she’s posing for, but IAN is silhouetted,\nbacklit by disco lights. He speaks with smug confidence.\n\nIAN\nNot bad. I’ve seen better, but you\nmake it work.\n\nShe’s not put off by the back-handed compliment. On the\ncontrary, it seems to make her try harder.\n\nMS. TASTY\nJerk.

SO WHEN DO I GET TO\nCHECK OUT YOUR BIG, SEXY BOD? L-O-L!”\n\nIan lets out a nervous giggle. He types his reply, “IT’S NOT\nREALLY THAT SEXY.” He stops and deletes that.\n\nIAN\n(whispering to himself)\nGod. Don’t be a dork. Act cool.\nBe a dick. Just be a dick.",

Ian\nplaces his own head on the tough guy’s body.\n\nAs he does this work, we get a look at the room, which is\ndivided by a line of electrical tape running down the wall\nmarked, \"DYLAN'S SIDE - IAN KEEP OUT!!!\" Ian's side is neat\nand sparsely decorated with a few band posters and some Lord\nof the Rings merch. The other side of the room is cluttered\nand decorated with extreme sports and bikini girl posters.\nSeveral motocross and snowboarding trophies are proudly\ndisplayed.
