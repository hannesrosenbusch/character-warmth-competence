This injury humiliated and \n\n                         embittered Lee Kinsolving, made \n\n                         him morose and violent, and perhaps \n\n                         caused him to drink to excess. The \n\n                         Defendant has admitted that there \n\n                         were bitter quarrels between herself \n\n                         and her husband. Such a quarrel \n\n                         took place on the night of his \n\n                         death, Upon the manner of that \n\n                         death this entire proceeding rests.\n\n\n\n               The Judge pauses and looks out over the courtroom, which \n\n               is very quiet now, He pours himself a glass of water and \n\n               takes a drink from it.\n\n\n\n                                     JUDGE\n\n                         In my summing up to the Jury I \n\n                         emphasized that the case for the \n\n                         prosecution was, as so many murder \n\n                         cases are, purely circumstantial. \n\n                         It was alleged that while Lee \n\n                         Kinsolving slept, perhaps in a \n\n                         drunken stupor and perhaps not, \n\n                         the Defendant removed the neck \n\n                         brace from his neck and jerked his \n\n                         head sufficiently to rupture the \n\n                         spinal cord and cause death. It is \n\n                         admitted that the Defendant was \n\n                         found holding the neck brace in \n\n                         her hand, and bending over her \n\n                         husband's body, which was lying on \n\n                         the bed. Not in the bed, mind you, \n\n                         but sprawled across it.  The \n\n                         Defendant has testified that lee \n\n                         Kinsolving himself removed the \n\n                         neck brace to torment her, as it \n\n                         were, with the great danger in \n\n                         which this placed him. Then he \n\n                         started to walk towards her, holding \n\n                         the brace in his hands, and that \n\n                         being unsteady on his feet, he \n\n                         stumbled and fell backwards across \n\n                         the bed.
