AWNINGS pulled down on\nVENDOR CARTS... ITALIAN SILK SHADES pulled down so a RICH\nGIRL can go back to bed. A messenger on a bicycle is grazed\nby a BMW. The well dressed driver zips down his window,\ncraning his neck -- not to see if the messenger’s okay, but\ninstead to inspect his car for scratches.\n\nTowards the gleaming towers of Midtown, the employed\nunderclass is walking, walking...\n\f.-. from the other direction walk a couple of CLUBBING RICH\nKIDS, still in their party clothes, having been out all\nnight...\n\n+.

He takes in the\ntableau at a glance -- the screaming dog-walker trying to\ncatch up, the bounding Afghan.\n\nIn a swift move, Cole plunks down 2 dollars on a vendor's\ncart and grabs a small SHISH KEBAB, waving it at the dog’s\neye level.

Well into his 70s, he knows no greater\npleasure than doing his job well.\n\fCHARLIE\nWhat about him?\n\nA GAGGLE of KIDS swarm through the lobby, off to school.\nCole knows all their names.
