A moment later a huge athletic figure emerges. \n---TARGET SECTION TO BE ANNOTATED---\n Ursus enters\nthe arena. Struck almost blind by the rays of the sun, he\nsquints and looks around. He is half naked and devoid of any\nweapon. He kneels down and bows his head as if in prayer. He\nfreezes in that position. The crowd begins to murmur, then\nscream.\n\f74.\n\nSCENE 88 DAY_EXT_ROME_CIRCUS\n\nThe left gate opens and an enormous German bull runs out. It\nhas a half naked girl tied to its back. With chapped lips, a\npale Vinicius whispers\n\nVINICIUS\nGod, I trust in you.\n\nHe closes his eyes and mouths a silent prayer.\n\nUrsus sees Lygia hanging limply across the bull’s back. He\ncharges towards the bull and extends his hands.\n\nURSUS\n(savage war cry) Ruuaaaaah!\n\nThe bull rears its powerful head, its horns ripping Ursus’s\nleft side. Blood pours from the wound.\n\nURSUS\n(a warriors’ shout of pain)\nUrraah!\n\nUrsus falls to the ground as the crowd roars and the bull\nruns around the arena.\n\nCROWDS\nGet him! Get him! Kill the giant!\nBleed him like a bull!\n\nThe injured Ursus struggles to get up. He sizes up the beast\nand then lunges at it, grabbing it by the horns.\n\nURSUS\n(warrior’s savage grunt and\ncry) Uuurrrrrrrah!\n\nThe bull starts shaking its head.\n\nUrsus tightens his muscles around the bull’s neck. The\nanimal pushes back. Ursus plants his feet in the ground,\nhalting the beast’s advance and they remain momentarily\nfrozen. A murmur of admiration rises from the crowd.\n\nUrsus begins to twist the bulls head. Straining his muscles\nto their limit, he throws the beast to the ground. The\nanimal’s head, held in the giant’s vise-like grip, begins to\ntilt downward. The beast lets out a roar as it begins to\nfoam at the mouth.\n\f75.\n\nA moment later, Ursus twists the bull’s head into an\nunnatural position. Roaring, it falls to the sand, kicking\nwith its hooves. Ursus kneels over the fallen beast, takes\nhold of Lygia and lifts her up.",

Mercy!\nSet them free!\n\nFrom all sides thumbs go up - a sign of mercy. The whole\narena is a forest of raised thumbs.\n\nNero does not want to accept their decision.

The pressure of the chanting crowd is\nenormous.\n\nCROWD\nArsonist! Murderer! Tyrant! Mother\nKiller! Despot! Redbeard! Down with\nCaesar! Nero the murderous dog!\nDown with tyranny!\n\nTigellinus gazes at the crowd. In the end, he too\nreluctantly raises his thumb. Suddenly, the crowd once again\nstarts shouting malevolently at Caesar.\n\nNero still has yet to deliver his judgment. He keeps looking\nfor at least one thumb turned down to support his decision.\n\f76.\n\nHe looks at Petronius. They stare at each other for a while.\nFirst, second, third look. And suddenly Petronius raises his\nhand and then holding this position, without taking his eyes\noff Nero, he changes direction and shows a thumbs down.\n\nIt is just as Petronius expected. Nero despises his former\nfriend, seeing in him the antithesis of everything he hates\nin his own life.

Petronius leans\non Eunice’s arm.

Their eyes are closed.\n\f77.\n\nOff screen can be heard a whispered conversation, but the\ncamera still continues to move backwards.

It\ndoes not envy, it does not boast,\nit is not proud. It does not\ndishonor others, it is not\nself-seeking, it is not easily\nangered, it keeps no record of\nwrongs.
