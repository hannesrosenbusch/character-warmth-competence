Some children accidently push a desk\nagainst his causing his pencil to move upwards. His picture is\nruined with a long straight line in the middle. His little,\npersonal world is disrupted with the bang causing the muffled\ntalking around him turn instantly clear.\n\nMRS. ZIMMERMAN stands at the front of the class taking\nattendance.\n\nMRS.
