BILLBOARD ROAD - DAY 1\n\nMILDRED HAYES, a woman in her early 50's, driving along a\ncountry road, passes an old billboard, roadside. Whatever\nadvert was on it is long since faded and torn. MILDRED drives\non, to a second billboard a few hundred feet along the road.\n\nShe notices this one a little more, though its old adverts\nare equally ramshackle. She slows to a stop.\n\nAfter looking up at the billboard a while, she slowly\nreverses and stops at the first, then at all three,\nstretching away to the quiet horizon.\n\nMakes a mental note of “EBBING BILLBOARD ADVERTISING”, then\ndrives on again, leaving the three old billboards alone like\ntombstones on the dusty road.\n\nINT.
