Open wide. The man's skin wet, speckled\nwith soil and flecks of blood. His breathing CLOSELY MIKED --\nerratic. This man's in shock. The SOUNDS of INSECTS and\nANIMALS other-worldly. A blink.\n\nThen, the REVERSE ANGLE: staring up hundreds of BAMBOO\nSTALKS. Sunlight almost impenetrable through the dense\nforest.\n\nSLIGHTLY WIDER on the Man's face as he stares upward,\ndisoriented, stunned. 40-years-old. Fit. In normal\ncircumstances, one glance would make you feel confident in\nhim. Trusting. But here, now, he's the one in trauma.\n\nHis name is JACK.\n\nThen, a RUSTLING SOUND -- something COMING -- it gets LOUDER\nand Jack suddenly SNAPS his head to the side to see something\nappear through the thick bamboo foliage --\n\nA WHITE LABRADOR.\n\nCollar. Tags. It stops abruptly, twenty feet away from\nJack, looking at him. And for the first time, we PULL BACK\nTO A WIDE SHOT of the intense, alien-looking BAMBOO FOREST.\nThe dog just stares at Jack, who we now see wears a BUSINESS\n\nSUIT and lies on his back, caught in broken bamboo stalks.\nAnd Jack just stares back.",

Something on his left side -- but we're so TIGHT\non his face that whatever he sees, we don't. Yet.\n\nHis reaction to his wound is more disappointed than\nterrified. He manages to get to his feet, feeling something\nin his jacket pocket.
