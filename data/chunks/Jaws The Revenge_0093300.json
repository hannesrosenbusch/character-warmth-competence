It thrashes about wildly then, in slow\n\tmotion, some twenty-five feet from the boat, right in front\n\tof it, the shark rises up out of the water, exposing half\n\tits body.  It seems suspended there, its great head pointed\n\tright at Ellen, its dead black eyes seeming to stare\n\tstraight at her.\n\n\tHolding fast to the wheel, her expression set hard, Ellen\n\tdrives the boat straight at the shark.  She pushes the\n\tthrottle forward, hard, getting the last bit of speed from\n\tthe engine, driving straight into the beast, impaling it in\n\tthe throat with what's left of the sharp jagged end of the\n\tbowsprit.\n\n\tThe shark goes crazy, its weight pulling the bow down into\n\tthe water as it tries to free itself, thrashing about so\n\tviolently that it turns the bow into splinters.\n\n\tEllen, Michael and Hoagie are thrown into the water.\n\n160\tTHE WATER - DAY\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t160\n\n\tThey watch as the shark dies its violent death, taking what\n\tremains of the boat beneath the surface with it.\n\n161\tBENEATH THE SURFACE - DAY\t\t\t\t\t      \n161\n\n\tThe shark and the boat sink slowly to the bottom.\n\n162\tTHE SURFACE - DAY\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t162\n\n\tEllen, exhausted, emptied of everything, begins to sob.\n\tEverything she feels, everything she's suppressed about\n\tSean's death pours out of her.  She begins to slip beneath\n\tthe surface.  Hoagie grabs her.\n\n\t\t\t\t   ELLEN\n\t\t   I can't....\n\n\t\t\t\t   HOAGIE\n\t\t   Yes you can....",
