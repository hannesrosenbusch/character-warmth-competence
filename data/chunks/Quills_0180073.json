Unable \n     to resist, COULMIER tugs the shroud off further, exposing \n     her shoulders. COULMIER marvels at her breasts, sloping \n     beneath the fabric. His heart pounds like a kettle drum.\n\n     Impulsively, COULMIER pulls the shroud all the way off. \n     MADELEINE lies before him, flawless. There are no wounds, no \n     sign of the gore which accompanied her death.\n\n     He gazes at her with an almost child-like wonder. Slowly, he \n     circles the body.  Tentatively, he reaches out his finger to \n     touch her lips; to trace the white porcelain of her \n     collarbone; perhaps even graze his hand across her breast. \n     He hesitates, then he leans down to kiss her. It's an almost \n     chaste moment, but it stuns her awake.\n\n     MADELEINE lives. COULMIER leaps back, alarmed. But MADELEINE \n     wraps her arms around his neck. She returns the kiss, \n     passionately.\n\n     It's all the encouragement COULMIER needs; he crawls astride \n     her on the slab.  Soon, he's running his hands in and out of \n     her rounded thighs, feeling each hollow, each moist crevice. \n     His touch grows from gentle to frantic as desire mounts.\n\n                           MADELEINE\n               Ah!\n\n     Roughly, COULMIER parts her legs. She grabs his back, her \n     nails digging into his skin, as though she were hanging on \n     for dear life. With a guttural sound--his Id, at last \n     unleashed--COULMIER grimaces with pleasure and enters her.\n\n     One savage thrust; then two. His eyes light on the crucifix \n     hanging across from him on the wall.\n\n     ANGLE ON: THE CRUCIFIX.\n\n     CHRIST's forehead is pierced through with nettles, and blood \n     flows in tiny rivers down his face.

In the din--flickering \n     orange--words. Everywhere, words. On the ceiling. Written on \n     the floor. Etched on the walls.  It's as if the TWO MEN have \n     stumbled into the tomb of Tutankhamen, with its glyphic texts, \n     or a Sanskrit monument covered in symbols.\n\n                           VALCOUR\n               He spat into his own filth.
