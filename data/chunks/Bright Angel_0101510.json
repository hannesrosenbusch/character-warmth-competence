DUCK MARSH - DAWN\n\nJACK RUSSELL and his 18-year-old son, GEORGE, crouch in a\nmakeshift cattail blind. Roosting ducks are dropping into\nthe marsh. on the water floats an arrangement of duck\ndecoys which have lured the ducks to the pond.\nIn the blind, Jack holds a long-barrel, semi-automatic\nshotgun. George mans a sealed-beam car-light hooked to a\nportable car battery. The light is not yet shining. Jack\npeeks through at the ducks while George keeps his head down,\nchecking and retwisting the connections to the battery.\nIt’s mid-June on the northern Montana Hi-line, and it’s\nchilly as the sky barely lightens eastward. The ducks :\nsettle and the marsh goes quiet. Jack, in the blind, takes\n_a long, deep breath, squeezes off the safety of his shotgun,\nregards his son beside hin.\n\nJACK\nShine, George. Shine now.\n\nGeorge clicks the crude switch on the car-light and the\nyellow beam streams out onto the marsh surface through the\ncattails. The ducks are there, all of them on the water,\ncompletely exposed and not yet alarmed by the light. Jack\nstands and begins shooting down on the water with the\nshotgun, methodical shooting, not fast, but gauged to cover\nas much of the water as he can. Most of the ducks are hit\nsitting in the water, but some fall just as they begin to\nlift off. Jack shoots, in all, eleven times. On the water\nafter the last gun blast, there are 54 ducks dead or dying.\n\nJACK\n\n(quietly)\nWell. There’s that.\n\nGEORGE\nYessir.\n\n. JACK\nA lot of ‘em. A lot of ‘em that\ntime. Good work on the light,\nGeorge. You were steady as a rock.\n\nJack and George begin to wade into the marsh to collect the\n' @ucks floating there.\nEXT.",
