He looks around the neighborhood\n\n          cockily, smiles, then kicks the bike into gear and rides\n\n          into the street. The camera rotates around him and comes\n\n          to rest on the back of his jacket, where we see a large\n\n          patch that reads \"Wild Hogs.\" The camera ZOOMS IN ON\n\n          THIS, and it becomes:\n\n\n\n                         TITLE CARD\n\n\n\n          MUSIC CUE CONTINUES OVER FOLLOWING SCENES:\n\n\n\n          EXT. BOB LEVENSTEIN'S HOUSE - SAME TIME\n\n\n\n          BOB creeps through the living room. From the kitchen, we\n\n          can hear KAREN, HALEY and CLAIRE screaming things at him,\n\n          about him, etc. He just tip-toes to the hall closet and\n\n          opens the door. We don't see what's in it, but see Bob\n\n          smile the same way Doug did, and...\n\n\n\n          SMASH CUT TO:\n\n\n\n          EXT. BOB'S DRIVEWAY - A MINUTE LATER\n\n\n\n          BOB, in leather biker gear, rolls out of his garage on\n\n          another shimmering Harley Davidson. He looks around\n\n          through his mirrored aviator sunglasses like a complete\n\n          bad ass. He looks down the street and spots DOUG, riding\n\n          towards him. Bob rides down the driveway and joins\n\n          alongside Doug. They nod silently to each other and tap\n\n          fists like the toughest guys in the world. We see Bob is\n\n          also wearing a \"Wild Hogs\" jacket.\n\n\n\n          EXT.

DUDLEY'S COMPUTER-CLUTTERED GARAGE - SAME TIME\n\n\n\n          We see a garage crowded with disassembled Apple\n\n          computers, printers, and a Harley Davidson Sportster.\n\n          Out walks DUDLEY, who's biker outfit doesn't quite mesh\n\n          with his thick-lensed eyeglasses.\n\n          Dudley cockily pulls on a \"Wild Hogs\" jacket, kick starts\n\n          the motorcycle, presses a button to open the garage door,\n\n          and rides the motorcycle out. However, as he gets\n\n          halfway out of the garage, the garage door catches on\n\n          something, and snaps back down. It clotheslines Dudley\n\n          off the bike, which rolls down the driveway and into some\n\n          garbage cans. Dudley lays in the driveway, staring up at\n\n          the sky with a pained look on his face.\n\n\n\n          EXT. DUDLEY'S DRIVEWAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER\n\n\n\n          DOUG, BOB and WOODY ride towards Dudley's house, but find\n\n          DUDLEY sitting in his driveway with his arms around his\n\n          knees. He shrugs and motions to his motorcycle - Which\n\n          he has stood back up, but has a bent wheel and smashed\n\n          headlight. Doug and Bob take in the situation and then\n\n          look at Woody. Woody rolls his eyes...\n\n\n\n          EXT. STREET - LATER\n\n\n\n          DOUG, BOB and WOODY ride along. We see DUDLEY is riding\n\n          bitch on Woody's bike, and Woody doesn't seem thrilled\n\n          about it. The camera pans around and we see they are all\n\n          wearing \"Wild Hogs\" jackets.

Tough\n\n          shit!\n\n          There's a moment of silence as Karen absorbs this. The\n\n          guys all look at Bob proudly.
