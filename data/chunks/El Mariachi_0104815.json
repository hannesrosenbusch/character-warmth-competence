A JAIL IN MEXICO - DAY\n\n               It's an early Friday morning and a patrol car drives up an \n               unpaved road and parks next to a gutted police car on cinder \n               blocks. The camera pans with the OFFICER as he exits his car \n               and walks up to a ramp leading to the baby blue JAIL HOUSE. \n               He is carrying a greasy bag of fast food.\n\n               INT.

He grabs a tin cup and \n               walks over to barred entrance to Block A. Twenty or so \n               CRIMINALS, from drunks to drug dealers are sleeping peacefully \n               in their cell on Block A.

The camera dollies slowly down the narrow hallway of \n               the block which has three cells: Two small ones side by side, \n               and one bigger cell that faces the block entrance. The sound \n               of scribbling and business dealing can be heard from inside \n               the cell. It is AZUL jotting into a business ledger while \n               chatting on his cellular phone. His cell is equipped with a \n               small desk and a refrigerator.

He stands ready to fight.\n\n               The Tall Men move slowly towards the big cell, somewhat \n               cautious. They see the Bodyguard a second too late, for he \n               sticks the shotgun between the bars, and shoots one of them \n               before they can react.

Azul's Bodyguard, amused by all this, opens \n               his cell door effortlessly, and walks out as if to greet \n               them. The Tall Men hear the sound of the other cells opening, \n               so they turn around. The other prisoners on the block begin \n               exiting their cells, carrying guns and Molotov cocktails. \n               The Tall Man drops his gun.

CORONA CLUB - DAY\n\n               Mariachi enters the club, greeting the PATRONS as he makes \n               his way to the bar. No one seems to greet him back. He sits \n               on a barstool near some OTHER DRINKERS, laying his guitar \n               case down lovingly beneath his stool. He looks around the \n               place, as if sizing it up.\n\n                                     BARTENDER\n                         What do you want to drink?\n\n                                     MARIACHI\n                         Refresco.\n\n               The other drinkers stare at him.\n\n               Glancing around the room, Mariachi notices a small, table-\n               shaped object draped with a cloth in one corner of the room.\n\n               Sitting directly behind him are four mean-looking dudes. \n               Mariachi is served his drink.\n\n                                     MARIACHI\n                         No hay musica?\n\n                                     BARTENDER\n                              (cleaning a glass)\n                         Why?\n\n                                     MARIACHI\n                         I'm a mariachi.

MOCO'S RANCH - DAY\n\n               Moco is walking away from the bodies.\n\n                                     MOCO\n                         Bring that musician out here so he \n                         can be reunited with my Domino.\n\n               Some men go to check.\n\n               Cut back and forth with Mariachi coming.\n\n                                     MEN\n                         He's gone, sir.\n\n                                     MOCO\n                         Find him!!\n\n               Mariachi rides through the semi-open gate... stopping at the \n               bodies. He dismounts the bike and holds Domino.\n\n               He has the gun in the back of his pants. You can see it while \n               his back is to the camera and men are approaching him. Moco \n               comes for the show.\n\n                                     MOCO\n                              (good shot)\n                         So you're the little mariachi that \n                         came to town, killed my men, and \n                         stole my girl...\n\n               Mariachi slowly lifts his eyes to Moco.\n\n                                     MOCO\n                         You are very talented.\n\n               Mariachi stands, hands up.\n\n                                     MOCO\n                         I bet you play the guitarra real \n                         well, huh?\n\n               Mariachi says nothing.\n\n                                     MOCO\n                              (raising gun)\n                         Not anymore.\n\n               Moco fires into Mariachi's left hand. Mariachi grimaces, \n               crumbling to the floor. He keeps a tight grip on his hand. \n               When he opens his hand to see the damage, the camera can see \n               right through his hand for a reverse shot of his face through \n               the hole.",

Mariachi tries to stand, but he falls back. \n               When he rises again he has the gun in his hand. He shoots \n               Moco in the chest. Moco falls back and hits the ground hard. \n               He gasps for air...\n\n               Moco's men gather around him. Mean Dude #5 crouches down to \n               check Moco's throat pulse. Moco's dead. Mean Dude #5 strikes \n               a match across Moco's face and lights up a cigarette. He \n               turns and walks away. The others follow.\n\n               Mariachi wraps a tourniquet on his arm, kisses Domino, opens \n               Azul's case, sees the weapons, and rides off with it.\n\n               MARIACHI ON THE ROAD\n\n               He looks back at the town behind him, then places his hand \n               on the motorcycle to drive off. We notice the metal brace on \n               his hand.\n\n               Mariachi rides into the sunset road. He speeds past a sign: \n               \"ACU-A 18 miles\"\n\n                               \"Coming soon EL MARIACHI II\"\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n                                         THE END"
