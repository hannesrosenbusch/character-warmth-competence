"In this article, we explore the viability ofestablishing a personality proﬁling system rooted in theBig Five model for movie characters. We curated acorpus sourced from movie scripts and proceeded toevaluate several traditional machine learning modelsalongside an LSTM model. Our ﬁndings indicatethat traditional machine learning outperforms the LSTMmodel in this context."

"Review:  On the one hand, there are works that aim to study and identify the personalities of fictional characters in literature or movies. On the other hand, there are works that aim to recreate personalities in virtual characters based on a predetermined model. We will therefore examine the works proposed by the scientific community for both approaches."

This conference paper introduces a novel corpus of fictional characters’ dialogue annotated with Big Five trait and gender labels. uses liwc corre;lations to validate gpt3.5 annotations of dialogues with big5 labels

This NLP study presents a new dataset and machine-learning models to predict novel protagonists’ Big Five traits from narrative text, exemplifying computational profiling of fictional characters’ agreeableness and other traits.

This paper introduces PERSONET, the first fine-grained dataset and task for tracking readers’ evolving understanding of characters’ personalities (covering many trait terms) as they read a novel, showing how personality attributions (beyond Big Five) emerge in literary contexts.

Analyzing large-scale audience ratings of fictional characters, this working paper finds that greater inconsistency in a character’s perceived personality (“personality incoherence”) leads to lower audience appreciation and enjoyment of the film. This directly links character trait coherence to audience response.

This interdisciplinary study uses automated text analysis to extract personality dimensions from 19th-century novels. It finds that Jane Austen’s characters are described with rich social-emotional nuance while Dickens’s center on power/dominance, illustrating how fictional character traits can be computationally derived and contrasted

This empirical media study shows that characters are central to audience engagement in fantasy films, observing that characters “have a central role in the reception of fictional content” and are key to building empathy. Though not Big Five–specific, it underscores the importance of character traits (like agreeableness) in how viewers respond to different genres.
